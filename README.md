# Out-of-the-box FP8 Training

Repo for the [out-of-the-box FP8 training](out_of_the_box_fp8_training.ipynb) notebook.

This provides a demo of using the `unit_scaling` library, showing how a model can be easily adapted to train in FP8.

## Using unit scaling

üìù **View the notebook**: [out_of_the_box_fp8_training.ipynb](out_of_the_box_fp8_training.ipynb)

üíª **Try the library**: [graphcore-research.github.io/unit-scaling](https://graphcore-research.github.io/unit-scaling/)

üìñ **Read the paper**: [arxiv.org/abs/2303.11257](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11257)

## Running the notebook

To speed up training, users can run for free on IPU: [![Run on Gradient](https://assets.paperspace.io/img/gradient-badge.svg)](https://console.paperspace.com/github/graphcore-research/out-of-the-box-fp8-training?container=graphcore/pytorch-paperspace%3A3.3.0-ubuntu-20.04-20230703&machine=Free-IPU-POD4&file=out_of_the_box_fp8_training.ipynb)

Note that the notebook & library work cross-platform, so can also be run on CPU/GPU.
