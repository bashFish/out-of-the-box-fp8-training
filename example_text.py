hansard_lords_1964 = """LORD STONHAM My Lords, after that genial, or nobly genial, interlude, I hope that it will be in order if I try to shed a little more light on the general proceedings. Your Lordships will remember that I had reached the point where I had expressed the Government's hope that in seven years the power plant construction programme would have reached parity with the demand that we then expect; and I said that to do that would entail, as at present estimated, an investment of some £4, 000 million. In that programme the production of electrical energy from nuclear plants will play an increasing part. It will be recalled that the first nuclear power programme suffered, under the previous Government, from several drastic changes of heart, but it managed to survive as a programme to provide 5,000 megawatts of nuclear generating capacity by 1969. Three stations are already supplying power to the Grid. Wylfa, the last station, will be commissioned in 1968 and 1969. All nine stations, including the Scottish station at Hunterston, are of the Magnox type developed by the Atomic Energy Authority at Calder Hall.
Last April, the previous Government announced "The Second Nuclear Power Programme", which planned to provide a further 5,000 megawatts of nuclear capacity to come into commission between 1970 and 1975. This programme which had been agreed by the C.E.G.B. and the A.E.A. was intended to be flexible, and subject to revision at regular intervals in the light of new information. We are all glad to know that the noble Lord, Lord Sherfield, who was until recently Chairman of the Atomic Energy Authority, will be able to take part in this debate. The A.E.A. and the C.E.G.B. having made a joint study of the available reactor systems for the new programme, agreed that the main contenders were: the advanced gas-cooled reactor (A.G.R.), which has been developed by the Atomic Energy Authority; the American water-moderated reactor systems, especially the boiling water reactor (B.W.R.); and, pressurised water reactor (P.W.R.). We really ought to congratulate the experts on providing such initials for these things that a layman like myself can understand what they represent. So often one has to have a special inquiry to see what the initials mean.
It was decided that the C.E.G.B. would invite tenders for an A.G.R. station to be built alongside the Magnox station now under construction at Dungeness, at the same time making it clear that it was also ready to consider tenders from British industry for "water-operated reactor systems of proved design". The previous Government intended to review the tenders with the C.E.G.B. and the A.E.A. before a decision was taken as to the type of reactor to be built. The tenders are to be submitted by February 1 next, and the Board, in consultation with the A.E.A., will then have to assess them and consult the Government. A decision, therefore, cannot be expected until well into the summer of next year. It must be borne in mind that whilst the capital cost of a conventional station is expected to fall to £37 per kw. by 1969, compared with an estimated £100 per kw. at the latest nuclear station at Wylfa, the running costs of a nuclear station are substantially less than those for conventional stations. Indeed, it is possible—some say likely—that by the early 1970's nuclear power may become cheaper than conventional power for the generation of the base load. But because of the many uncertainties it is obvious that the programme must be flexible and subject to review.
Electricity now accounts for an increasing proportion of the nation's total energy requirements. Between 1953 and 1963, it rose from less than 17 per cent. to nearly 30 per cent., and this increase is expected to continue. Last year, nuclear power contributed around 4 per cent. of the total units of electricity produced, but if the two nuclear programmes are com- pleted as planned, the proportion by 1975 will be over 16 per cent. But by then the fuel requirements for electricity generation will have doubled, and ten years hence coal will still be the major fuel used by the industry.
It is understandable that your Lordships' House and the industry are anxious to secure answers to a number of important questions, but my right honourable friend has not yet had an opportunity to consider "The Second Nuclear Power Programme." Meanwhile, arrangements for tenders for the first station are going forward, and it is likely that it will be designed and constructed by one of the three consortia, all of whom have been invited to submit tenders for a comprehensive contract. The consortium method enables the novel design and construction problems of a nuclear station to be tackled as a whole. In the course of time, as standard designs become feasible, it may be found preferable to have direct contracts with specialist firms, as is now done with the building of conventional stations. How soon this may be depends on the way the technique of building these stations develops.
The noble Lord, Lord Hawke, suggests that nuclear stations have a longer life than the present assumption of 20 years, and that the availability is not 75 per cent., but more than 90 per cent. There is one staggering example quoted—I believe it was at Calder Hall—where the availability at one time was 99 per cent. These are points of vital importance in assessing the relative costs of power from nuclear and conventional stations. The noble Lord asked me what was the estimated cost of the latest nuclear station—and I take it that he was referring to Wylfa. I understand that, with less conservative grounds—that is to say, a life of 25 years and 85 per cent. availability—the cost of Wylfa will be virtually the same as the cost from the conventional means of production.
LORD HAWKE My Lords, before the noble Lord leaves that point, has he by any chance worked out what difference a 30-year life would make? He has jumped up the availability from 75 to 85 per cent., and if he jumps the life up from 20 to 30 years, what difference in cost would that make? Has he the figures?
37
LORD STONHAM My Lords, I think that in something so new as this, where there are so many imponderables and where our experience is so limited, one cannot be precise about these matters. I have said that it is possible, perhaps even likely, that in the early 's generation by nuclear means may be cheaper than by conventional means and I have given the noble Lord the forecast by adjusting the ground rules to the extent which I suggested—25 years and 85 per cent. availability. But we must not forget that this is a hypothetical example. If we adjusted the ground rules up to 30 years, that might lead to the assumption, which might prove quite false, that these stations have a life of 30 years. In any case, these points will be fully considered by the Board.
We are also fully aware that a programme of.5, 000 mw. is insufficient to keep the three consortia fully employed, and in the light of this situation the future organisation of that part of the industry is under review inter-departmentally. Meanwhile, whilst awaiting the results of the inquiry for tenders, all these relevant matters are being constantly and closely considered. Obviously, however, I cannot go further in anticipating the Government's decisions.
The noble Lord, Lord Hawke, said that coal should have been included in his Motion and that it cannot be ignored. Coal must form the basis of the production of a great deal of our energy for some years to come. The noble Lord also said, if I took his words down aright, that continuous production from losing pits would be intolerable unless there were very special reasons for it.
LORD HAWKE I said that in the short term it would be tolerable, but in the long term intolerable.
LORD STONHAM My Lords, the noble Lord is aware that I was not trying to misquote him. I was just trying to get the sense of what he said. The National Coal Board's policy is aimed directly at the elimination of uneconomic production. This of course, involves the modernisation and reconstruction of existing pits and the closure of pits which have no prospect of covering their operational costs before deprecia- tion and interest. This process has been going on a long time and is continuing now. When I say that, I exclude, of course, those pits which are running at a loss just at the particular moment—for example, because of temporary geological difficulties, or because they are in process of reorganisation and construction. Pits will not be closed unless modern methods cannot make them viable.
The major part of the Coal Board's reconstruction programme, which was undertaken in the 1950's, when the demand for coal exceeded the capacity of the industry to produce, is now completed. The annual expenditure on major colliery schemes has been reduced by nearly 50 per cent. since 1959 and is expected to decline still further in the next few years. Indeed, in recent years the coal industry has done well in adjusting itself to mounting competition from other fuels. But despite the present level of production, it is still facing a difficult task. Because of the change in the pattern of its markets, the lower-priced electricity coals providing an even greater proportion of its outlets, the coal industry needs a higher annual increase in productivity than most other industries to meet the inevitable increases in wages and other costs, and to keep prices stable. Thus, there is a continuing need for modernisation to improve the efficiency and profitability of existing collieries.
A growing proportion of capital expenditure, now running at about £90 million a year, will be needed on schemes, such as the reorganisation and mechanisation of existing collieries, at the pit face and away from it, and the replacement of existing worn-out or uneconomic machines with more modern and improved equipment. The Board's investment programme includes expenditure on processing coal, for houses, for research and development projects, for brick-making and other ancillary activities. Legislation will be needed to extend the Board's borrowing powers, and that will have to come before the end of next year. As my right honourable friend stated in another place on December 1, he is reviewing, in collaboration with the National Coal Board, the prospects for the coal industry in relation to a coordinating policy for fuel. All matters concerning the Board's long-term investment programme will come under review. The possibility of a capital reconstruction to relieve the coal industry of some of its capital charges has been widely canvassed. That will have to be borne in mind in the course of the review to which I have referred; but this will require legislation. I have no doubt that the objective of securing our fuel supplies on the most economic terms will be viewed against the probable social and economic consequences of declining coal production.
The noble Lord, Lord Hawke, asked what would be the effect of the present interest rates on the power programme. Bank rate naturally has a direct immediate effect upon the structure of short-term interest rates, but its effect on long-term rates, such as those charged to the Electricity and Gas Councils, is less immediate and much more limited in effect. The Councils will already be paying a higher rate of interest on their overdrafts from commercial banks as a result of the recent increase in bank rate, but these overdrafts are not used to finance the capital investment programmes: they are employed for working capital. As far as long-term borrowing is concerned, however, the rise in bank rate will have no effect whatsoever upon existing loans, and the rates for new loans have not been increased. Whether the rate on new loans will be increased depends upon the effect bank rate has upon long-term rates of interest in general; and as it is in the interest of the Exchequer and the industries to avoid frequent changes, it is the custom to await such time as a level establishes itself before making a change. Such a level is not at present established.
The noble Lord also asked about the effect of inflation on generating costs over the next 25 years. It is not possible, of course, to forecast—even Lord Hawke's Old Moore could not forecast it—what inflation will take place over the next 25 years. It is part of the Government's basic policy to seek stability of prices, but much will depend on the success of their incomes policy. However, if the value of money does continue to fall, there is no reason to think that the costs of electricity will increase more than prices generally. Indeed, the probability is entirely the other way. Over the last ten years, while the general price index has increased by about 32 per cent., the average price of a unit of electricity has increased by only 18 per cent. This is because the use of vastly larger generating equipment has brought great economies in capital cost per unit generated, and increased sales have proportionately reduced overheads. Rising coal costs have been offset by more efficient generating plant, by the use of poorer grades and relatively less expensive coals, and by rationalising the transport of coal to power stations. These factors should continue to operate, and, in the long run, nuclear power may also bring economies to offset price inflation.
The noble Lord, Lord Hawke, also mentioned the prospects for pumped storage. Here I cannot hold out hope of any great expansion. We fully recognise that pumped storage stations have a longer working life than the conventional generating plants that would otherwise have to be installed to meet peak demand, and the quick response of hydroelectric plant is especially valuable in coping with sharp fluctuations in electricity demand and emergency conditions. Unfortunately, although the outlook is favourable in Scotland, the topography limits the number of suitable pumped storage sites in England and Wales.
The noble Lord, Lord Hawke, mentioned the pumped storage scheme at Ffestiniog which was brought into operation in December, 1961. Its eventual capacity is 360 mw., and the Generating Board say that the project is providing peak period Lord power efficiently and economically. In North Devon the Generating Board have started exploratory surveys, including trial borings, at two sites to assess their suitability for pumped storage. Then the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board have a project at Cruachan which, with a capacity of 400 mw., will be the second largest pumped storage project in the world. It will be commissioned next year and in 1966. The Hydro-Electric Board are also considering the possibility of a pumped storage scheme at Loch Sloy near Loch Lomond. The capacity, at 1,200 mw., would make it the largest in the world. Those are the projects that we have in mind.
With regard to the future of pumped storage, like nuclear generation costs, pumped storage costs have been reduced, but they have to compete with the steady fall in the capital cost per kw. of conventional power stations. However, further gains from advances in the technology of conventional generation are likely to be less spectacular than they have been in the past. This may make pumped storage schemes more attractive, as will the growing availability of nuclear power, when the capacity of nuclear power plant is sufficient to supply the minimum Lord on the system and surplus low cost nuclear energy begins to be available for night pumping. But this is some way in the future. Meanwhile, the Boards are ready to examine any projects where the circumstances are likely to be favourable.
As I said when I began, this is one of the most important items—if not the most important—in the foundation of our economy. On the generation and production of power rest the whole of our hopes for a steadily increasing national productivity, our standards of living and, indeed, our power, in a different sense, in the world. It is impossible to overestimate its importance. The Government realise this, and everything that can be done will be done in order to ensure that the power is there as and when it is required, and that it is produced in as diverse a fashion as required and in the most efficient and economic manner possible.

LORD WOLVERTON My Lords, I am sure we are all grateful to my noble friend Lord Hawke for initiating this important debate in your Lordships' House this afternoon, because after the policy on Defence, the power policy, or fuel policy, of this nation is in my opinion—and I think in that of all your Lordships—the most important. It is only right, with a new Government in office, that we should examine this policy afresh. My only excuse for getting up to speak this afternoon is that I want to say a word or two on the atomic energy programme for the next five years. I was delighted to see (he has gone now) the noble Lord, Lord Snow.
Following me is the noble Lord, Lord Sherfield. I understand that responsibility for the Atomic Energy Authority will now pass from the Minister for Educa- tion and Science, whose responsibility it was in the late Government, to the new Ministry of Technology. I think this is a good thing, and that they will be able to study this great problem afresh.
We have made tremendous advances as pioneers in developing atomic power stations. The noble Lord, Lord Hawke, and I were privileged to go down last summer and spend a day at Bradwell, and we are most grateful to the Generating Board for the time they gave to us in explaining everything to us. It is a wonderful station. At that time it was the largest station in the world. It has now been superseded by Dounreay, in Scotland.
LORD HOBSON Hunterston.
LORD WOLVERTON I think that that one is now the largest station in the world. All these nine stations are based on the Magnox system, and their cost of generating electricity is about ⅔d. per unit, against ½ d. with coal. That is a big difference. As your Lordships know, coal has made a tremendous advance in the last few years on high steam pressures. The noble Lord, Lord Hawke, said that probably we are beginning to see the end of the advancement that can be made on that.
The point I wanted to make this afternoon is that the General Electric Company consortium have nearly completed a very large station in Japan. That is based on the Magnox system. We have an order for another one in Italy, which is, I think, running now and the one in Japan is about to run. I read in the Press the other day that the Japanese are thinking of giving some more orders for stations, but are now looking to America for the boiling-water reactor system. We had a great debate about this in your Lordships' House on June 10. We were assured then that the Atomic Energy Authority had made great advances with the advanced gas-cooled reactor, and that specifications would go out to British manufacturers to quote for a station of the advanced gas-cooled reactor type, to be placed side by side with the station of the Magnox type which is running this autumn at Dungeness.
If the Japanese are now thinking of turning to America for their next stations, it will be a great disappointment to this country. We must do a great deal more research. I think it was agreed last summer that the Generating Board, if they wished, could import one set of American design of boiling-water reactor, to be put up and tested against our own advanced gas-cooled station, in order to see which was the more efficient type. Obviously, we must have greater efficiency if we are to compete with America.
In my view, there is a tremendous future in atomic energy power stations, but so often, as I said in the debate in June, pioneers get left behind. So I am hoping that, as Her Majesty's Government have said to-day, the programme will continue to be flexible, as the late Government said it would be. I also hope that a great deal more research—urgent research—backed up by the new Ministry of Technology, will be carried out by the Atomic Energy Authority, in consultation with the manufacturers and the Generating Board, to see whether we cannot get astride of the Americans. I understand, from a very good speech which the noble Viscount. Lord Caldecote, made in June, that although the Americans have not built any commercial station, the big companies in America have spent a large sum of money on research and confidently expect their boiling-water system of reactor to be the best in the world. We must try to get as good as they have, and it is a problem, in my humble submission, which needs a tremendous amount more research.
We must go on with the present programme of stations which for some years to come, presumably, unless they make big advances at this experimental station on the Magnox system, will not be as economical as the most efficient coal station. We have recently seen an instance of that in these very large power lines, one of which is almost completed. It passes all through East Anglia and Eastern England, coming down from Yorkshire to Waltham Cross.
It is a huge line, a 400, 000-volt line, with four conductors to each phase, and carries a very large Lord to bring the power down from Yorkshire coalfield stations along the Trent to London. I think it has been tapped twice—or it will be, eventually—near Cambridge and King's Lynn. But primarily it is for London, and with this great increase in voltage which they have now been able to develop, it is cheaper to bring down power from the generating station on the Trent, using the East Midlands coalfield, rather than to bring down the coal, even by sea, to the Thames-side station. But these great pylons are very ugly. They are something like 160 feet high, and dominate the landscape. I have great sympathy with some of the views expressed in the debate we had in your Lordships' House the other day on this problem. It is out of the question to put the cables underground, owing to the enormous cost.
I hope that we shall be able to develop more of these atomic energy power stations, which are admirably suited to the South. We already have some, on the East coast, on the Severn, and on the South coast. We must get on quickly with this important research to see whether we can get the reactors to stand up to higher steam pressure, so as to be able to produce the current required at a cost that is more in competition with that of the most efficient coal station.

LORD SHERFIELD My Lords, if I limit my remarks this afternoon to atomic energy, it is because this aspect of the subject is the one with which I have the larger acquaintance, and not because I wish to press for the preferential treatment of nuclear fuel over other fuels. With the ever-increasing demand, each fuel has its part to play, and the problem for any Government is to strike the best balance between them. There are three points to which I should like to draw particular attention. They are the selection of the type, or types, of reactor to be introduced into the electricity generating system in the United Kingdom between 1970 and 1975; the rate at which atomic energy should be introduced into the United Kingdom electricity system, and, perhaps more particularly, the question of our organisation in this field. On the first point, a procedure for the selection of types has been laid down and, as has been said, we have to await the submission of tenders by the consortia and their assessment. Therefore, no more can be said on this matter this afternoon.
But I should like to make this observation. There must be a very strong presumption in favour of choosing for the next stage of the nuclear power programme a system which has been developed by our scientists and engineers in the Authority, in industry, and in the Central Electricity Generating Board and of which we now have profound experience. The chosen line of development for British power reactors, the graphite gas-cooled system, has technically been extremely successful. After some avoidable and some unavoidable delays, the early stations are working well. For example, Hunterston, to which the noble Lord, Lord Wolverton, referred, at one time almost written off as an expensive failure, was, within two months of the second of the two reactors being commissioned, reported as already achieving an output of electricity some 7 per cent. more than its design capacity. The Tenth Annual Report of the Atomic Energy Authority gave the most encouraging information about the progress of the prototype of the second generation of reactors, the advanced gas-cooled reactor at Windscale.
I have been much concerned by the way in which public statements and many articles in the Press have over three or four years now tended to cast doubt on the products of the British system. Why this is so I do not know. Perhaps it is part of a general tendency to self-depreciation and denigration of our own performance which has recently become rather fashionable. I deplore this, not only because I think it is fallacious, but also because full advantage has been taken of it by our enterprising and vigorous competitors to press the merits of their own systems. My belief is that not only will the present generation of graphite gas-cooled reactors prove to be successful technically, but also that they will, in practice and with greater operating experience, give a much better economic return than at present is expected of them. The noble Lord, Lord Hawke, gave some of the reasons, and, without being dogmatic or going into the various ground-rules which are laid down from time to time to calculate these matters, I am convinced that these reactors will, in fact, perform much better than has been estimated.
As regards the advanced types, there seems very little doubt that any of them could, if built on a sufficient scale, produce power at substantially cheaper rates than that which would be available from any other contemporary source of electricity. Secondly, I think in forecasting their likely economic performance the result in each case and I refer, of course, to the British, American and Canadian types of reactor—would be the same within the margin of error. If this is so, the presumption in favour of the British system must surely prevail.
My Lords, the question of the rate at which atomic power should be introduced into the United Kingdom involves both technical and non-technical considerations. Technically, atomic power stations have a number of advantages over coal and oil stations. They are free from grit, dust, fumes and sulphur dioxide. They can be fuelled by a few tons of fuel elements a month, which can be brought in in a single load, and they are. therefore, almost immune to transport difficulties, for example, in very cold weather. The main hazard associated with them is some catastrophic accident resulting in the release into the atmosphere of radioactivity. But a great deal of research and development has gone into making nuclear power reactors safer than safe, and there is now every assurance that the effects of even the most improbable failure in a nuclear installation would be contained within the building in which it occurs. This improvement in safety devices should lead to a relaxation, where this is necessary, of the restrictions on the siting of nuclear power stations which were drawn up in the days when experience with nuclear reactors was a fraction of what it is to-day. The criterion of that time was what was known as the "maximum credible accident"—and it will be clear, I think, that anybody who regulated his life on such principle would never get out of bed.
It seems, therefore, that atomic power has now proved that it is technically efficient, safe and reliable, and that it has certain advantages over other types of energy for power production. But there is a major problem of finance. Broadly speaking, a nuclear power station costs about three times as much to build and about one year longer to construct than a conventional power station. On the other hand, a nuclear power station costs about a third as much to run as a conventional station. Nuclear power is, therefore, highly capital intensive. As the noble Lord, Lord Hawke, implied (and I know this is a sensitive point) it could be argued, on the assumption that inflation is likely [...] continue at a more or less steady ra[...] that it would be desirable to build a large number of nuclear power stations as rapidly as possible. On the other hand, the nuclear power programme has to compete with other capital projects, such as roads, education and the other huge commitments which successive Governments have assumed.
My own view has been that the target figure of 5,000 mw. of additional nuclear power by 1975, tentatively recommended in last year's White Paper, having regard to the effect of economics of scale on the cost of nuclear power is on the low side—certainly at the bottom end of the desirable bracket. Clearly, there are difficult questions of priorities and national interest, and I am not surprised to hear that the Government need more time than they have had to examine all the aspects of this question before they are able to reach a conclusion.
There is, however, one point of special importance. Most of the systems at present under consideration for future nuclear power generation require the fuel to be uranium enriched in the isotope Uranium 235. It is therefore essential to prepare a source of supply. We have at Capenhurst an isotope separation plant of the diffision type which provides us with a source of indigenous material. Construction of this plant against time some fifteen years ago represents one of the great post-war triumphs of the British engineering industry, little publicised, but, in comparison with the experience of similar plants abroad, highly significant. At present, it is working at a low level in the absence of military demand for enriched uranium, and, for reasons which are fairly well known, its product would not at present compete in price with that which is now available from the United States. However, at the cost of a relatively small further capital investment it could be brought up to date and its product would be, if not equal to, at least within range of, the American price, and no doubt in practice both sources of supply would be drawn upon.
In the past[...] have been suggestions that the factory at Capenhurst should be closed down. It seems to me imperative that this should not be done. Here is a technological process of the most advanced kind in which we have a leading position. Here is a semi-processed material which, quite apart from its military importance, will become increasingly required for civil purposes. It would seem to be to be an act of folly to discontinue this process in the United Kingdom or to fail to bring it up to date and thus leave the production and supply of this material in the hands, however friendly, of the United States, of France, of the Soviet Union or perhaps of some other country in the future.
The rest of the nuclear fuel cycle is now fully provided for by an efficient fuel element factory at Springfield and efficient fuel processing plants at Windscale and Dounreay. All these plants have ample capacity for the foreseeable needs both at home and abroad. With these facilities the production group of the Atomic Energy Authority has in the last year or so been successful in obtaining foreign business worth many millions of pounds. This is an indication that though these facilities were primarily designed for domestic purposes, both civil and military, they are producing a return in the export field which is far from negligible. Clearly a decision on the United Kingdom programme in favour of a British system would greatly help these activities.
I now turn to organisation. At the present time our own nuclear industry is, I think, in a state of uncertainty and transition. There is, I believe, much to be said for the view that this is due mainly to the way in which we have organised ourselves for the production of nuclear plant. In retrospect it seems unfortunate that when it was decided to exploit the graphite gas-cooled reactor system commercially no fewer than five different industrial consortia were formed for the purpose and that five different applications of the system were ordered. Accordingly five different design and development teams had to be established, and the Atomic Energy Authority was given the difficult task of developing simultaneously five different types of fuel elements. No doubt the extent of the market was at that time overestimated. No doubt it was right not to put all our eggs in one basket, or perhaps I should say one pressure vessel. There was perhaps an assumption—fallacious in my opinion—that the existence of five different groups would preserve a degree of real competition for the generating boards.
But, however good the reasons, the fact is that our competitors in other countries have managed to concentrate their industrial effort and their resources from the outset, whereas our effort and resources have been dispersed. The Americans have taken advantage of the economies of scale while we have persisted in the policy of the "one-off"; and although certain changes have now been made, I do not think that on the production side we have yet recovered from the handicaps which our system of organisation has imposed upon us and which certainly in the export field have robbed us of the highest prizes.
On the demand side, the two Generating Boards were already established as monopoly purchasers and the Atomic Energy Authority became, in practice if not as a matter of policy, a monopoly supplier for fuel elements. I believe that the concepts of a monopoly purchaser and a monopoly supplier are bad in principle. Both tend to the exercise of excessive influence, though of course a monopoly supplier is in a weaker position than a monopoly purchaser, since it is always open to the latter to look overseas. The Electricity Council and the Central Electricity Generating Board have single-mindedly pursued the laudable object of cheap power for the electricity consumer. But a single criterion does not necessarily resolve a problem, nor does it follow, to borrow a transatlantic expression, that what is good for a public board is good for a country. Other factors of a political, strategic and social nature have to be brought into the assessment, which only the Government of the day can make. Such matters cannot be settled by public boards, in this case, for example, by the Atomic Energy Authority alone or the Central Electricity Generating Board alone, or by both together.
And let me say, in parenthesis, that this latter contingency is by no means as remote as might be supposed. Indeed, I wish I could do something to lay the ghost of the supposed bitter antagonism between the Central Electricity Generating Board and the Atomic Energy Authority, of which I have read so much. I believe that the supply of fuel elements is now entirely satisfactory both to the Authority and to the Board, and, as far as development is concerned, it is quite natural and healthy that there should be some difference of approach and judgment between the developer and the operator. But I believe that the relationship between these two bodies is now good, and in fact the issue lies, in my observation, much more between the Generating Boards and industry than between the Boards and the Authority, and although some changes have been made I doubt whether this situation is even yet satisfactory.
The Central Electricity Generating Board has built up its own team of scientists and engineers with prime experience of the graphite gas-cooled system, and this has, not unnaturally, created a tendency to multiply the requirements, the specifications and the paraphernalia of tendering, which imposes an almost intolerable burden on those concerned with the designing of nuclear power stations. The curious thing is—and I stand open to correction on this—that the Generating Board seem prepared to take on trust from foreign suppliers what they are not prepared to take on trust from British suppliers. This means that the foreign tender costs less to make, and there is a built-in temptation for United Kingdom firms to take the easy way out and accept the foreign designs. This state of affairs is discouraging both to the industry as far as overseas orders are concerned and to the foreign purchaser in regard to his confidence in the British product.
LORD STONHAM My Lords, may I interrupt the noble Lord? Can he give any evidence of the C.E.G.B. being less rigorous in their requirements in respect of foreign reactors than those of our own production?
LORD SHERFIELD Since the C.E.G.B. has intimate experience of the graphite gas-cooled reactor system, they know much more about it and therefore are much more particular, whereas so far as foreign systems are concerned, since they have not been involved in the research and development they are more inclined—and I am not saying it is not quite natural—to take what is offered on trust; and this appears to produce a situation of some inequality, which I think is regrettable.
I know of no way of moderating the power of a large public monopoly otherwise than by governmental influence. I suggest that the present situation is having a harmful effect on the chances of our industry competing with foreign suppliers or maybe even of staying in business and that there is a prima facie case for Government intervention; and I was glad to hear from the noble Lord, Lord Stonham, that this situation is under review. I think the least the Government ought to do is satisfy themselves, in assessing the different systems of nuclear power generation, that the conditions and assumptions made are precisely the same in the case of the domestic and of the foreign systems in comparison.
Too often in the recent past we have led the world in early research and development of a new invention or process, and then at a later stage of the development have allowed the ball to be taken from our hands and carried off by our American or other competitors. This may sometimes have been due to lack of resources, sometimes to faulty or wasteful organisation, but perhaps also to a certain failure of will and resolution. Are we going to allow this to happen also in the civil applications of atomic energy?
Important decisions lie before the Government here, and they will need to be taken in the next few months. There are the decisions about the nuclear power programme to which I have referred. There is a decision on the construction of a prototype fast reactor power station, in the design and development of which we are, thanks to the experimental facility at Dounreay, still, I believe, ahead of the rest of the world. There is a decision about the future of the diffusion plant at Capenhurst. The Government have proclaimed their strong interest in the technological advance of this country. Here is a field in which we are in all respects already in the forefront, and in some respects still, though perhaps not for much longer, ahead of other countries. The moment of decision is near, and the issue is whether to push the machine over a dead centre and go forward, or allow it to fall back and watch our competitors reap the benefit of all the effort which has been put into equipping ourselves with the capital works and the scientific and engineering know-how for the production of nuclear power and the other benefits of the nuclear age. I hope that we shall have the courage and the confidence to back our own horses.
THE EARL OF BESSBOROUGH My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, I wonder whether I could ask him one question. He made a most interesting suggestion about the conversion of Capenhurst. Can he give us a rough estimate of what this will cost for the purposes he has in mind?
LORD SHERFIELD My Lords, I would prefer not to do that, because I am a little out of date as regards some of these calculations.

LORD FERRIER My Lords, I propose to confine the few remarks I have to make to a much more pedestrian subject than that with which the noble Lord has dealt in such an interesting way, and to confine myself to electricity supply in general terms and within the four corners of the Motion of the noble Lord, Lord Hawke, in respect of future investments and in drawing attention to the Annual Reports of the Electricity Council, et cetera.
As has been clear to your Lordships from what has been said in the debate, electricity is no longer a matter which can be dealt with in isolation when one is considering the power requirements of the nation. But it is a highly efficient section of our nationalised industry. I am sure I am speaking with your Lordships' sympathy when I say how pleasant it is to see with us to-day the noble Lord, Lord Citrine, who presided during the difficult years of the formation of this nationalised industry, which is most efficiently run, although, of course, it is well to remember that another method of employing and harnessing the electricity power of the nation might be found to operate more easily, and more economically in the long run.
But I want to draw particular attention to a paragraph in the Report of the Electricity Council where, in referring to the announcement in January last that there will be further upward charges in the bulk tariffs, it says: This was to enable the Board to meet the higher costs associated with the expansion of their capital programmes and with the increased use of the older and less efficient power stations due to the shortage of plant. This seems to me to call into question a matter of principle. If it means that existing tariffs are not high enough to cover depreciation and amortisation of existing plant, then certainly the tariffs are too low. If that is the case, they must be raised. Perhaps in that measure the increased tariffs may stem from inflation, as other noble Lords have said to-day; but that again is another matter. In my view, it is not correct to contemplate the raising of tariffs to enable the Board to meet the higher costs associated with the expansion of their capital programmes.
We have had some glimpse, not only in the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Sherfield, of the enormous figures which are involved when we come to generation by atomic power. It is fair to bear in mind that to increase tariffs to-day in order to meet increased capital costs in the future can well be interpreted as charging existing consumers higher rates so that future consumers can benefit. As the noble Lord, Lord Stonham, made plain at the end of his speech, we must remember that power tariffs are the life blood of the economy of this country, and increased rates now may well mean increased costs for industry now, and such might have long-term effects, including the restriction of industrial expansion. Another effect of reduction of industrial expansion is a curtailment of future Lord requirements in relation to electricity supply.
One matter, which perhaps the noble Lord who is to reply might deal with in his speech, and which has confused me and may well confuse other noble Lords, is that on the one hand we have a statement that increased costs must be met by higher tariffs, and yet it is perfectly plain—the noble Lord, Lord Hawke, made this point in his speech—that as atomic power develops in efficiency, and as thermal stations develop in efficiency, so the cost per kilowatt goes down. My mind is not clear on where that affects an approach to electricity tariffs in respect to this intimation that they may have to be raised in order to meet increased costs.
On my next point, which to my mind is not of the same weight but is of general principle, I think it is easier to turn to Scotland and to the problems of the Hydro-Electric Boards. I think that perhaps the best thing to do is to turn to the Mackenzie Report where, at page 9, it says that the Committee envisaged that the Board would co-operate in schemes for the regeneration of the Highlands. To my mind, and in my own personal experience, there is here a big problem in regard to how much of the cost of general social benefits, rural benefits—call them what you will—is fairly chargeable to the cost of electricity. Here I believe that a great deal of careful thinking may still be required.
Other noble Lords have indicated that there is going to be plenty of thinking ahead for those who are going to plan our power development. The point I wish to make is that in their thinking let it be borne in mind (and I am not belittling the achievements of the Hydro-Electric Boards or anything like that) that the cost of any amenity other than what is specifically related to the production of electricity could well be said to be chargeable to the State and not to the consumer, which is where it ends up, if it is included in the cost of the production of power.
I should like to turn to what has been mentioned about off-peak generation and pumped storage. No mention has been made to-day—and I do not recall having seen anything about it in the Board's report—of the fact that the gas turbine can produce a "peaking" unit which is very rapidly capable of being placed on load, but pumped storage equipment provides for the consumption of off-peak power. The price which hydro stations can supply for peaking at the present rate is, I know, equal to or below that at which the thermal stations would have to supply into the system if old plant were to be used. But is this particular approach low enough? Should it not be the case, if, as I suggest, there is an element of social cost in the price output of hydro power, that the lower cost at which they can supply should be the measure at which a hydro station could feed into the system at peak hours? On the subject of pumped storage the Cruachan plant is of wonderful construction, and had the advantage of being completed a month or so ahead of time. One additional advantage, which it is well to bear in mind, is that it has a catchment area which of itself provides many kilowatts of power.
As for off-peak load, suggestions have been made of various outlets for this power. I, personally, feel that not enough attention has been given to the possibility of pumping water, both for water supply and for the de-watering of mines and the like, on off-peak tariff. There must be a stage at which off-peak tariffs can reach a rate at which double or triple shift working may be possible with electric power in various industries, though not all of them. Has that stage been reached in any of our industries? Are our off-peak tariffs really attractive enough to bring on Lord all the industries and all the apparatus that might be brought on load?
I feel that it is worth turning to the matter of thermal storage heating, which has been referred to in various reports. There has been a remarkable growth in 1963-64, amounting to a 70 per cent. increase in the use of unit plant storage heaters for space heating in domestic establishments. This is a remarkable growth, and it is well to remember the fact that the domestic storage type heater was made available to domestic users stemming from a Question and Answer in this House. But an increase of that measure cannot be expected year by year, because this related to a time when domestic storage type heaters were not available.
I may have spoken in a very theoretical and perhaps rather pedestrian way, but I have spoken on these matters of basic principle which, within their limits of practicability, remain principles. I urge the Government in their thinking to keep these matters of principle in mind. Listening to your Lordships to-day has certainly given me the feeling that the thinking which needs to be done—and which in the light of what the noble Lord, Lord Sherfield, has said must be done—will be a fascinating adventure. Certainly more time is needed to study the matter. The point which I wish to make is the relationship between finance for the future and tariff formulation to-day and in the years to come. This is of paramount importance.

THE EARL OF DUDLEY My Lords, I should like to congratulate most heartily the noble Lord, Lord Hawke, on the admirable way in which he presented his important Motion. I should also like to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Stonham (I am sorry to see he is not in his place), for the very satisfactory reply which he made to many of the questions raised by Lord Hawke. It has been a most interesting debate; it has covered a very wide field, but it has clarified a great many problems which we all want to know something about.
In my younger days, before the nationalisation of the coal and gas industries, I was closely in touch in many directions with the gas industry. I still follow its progress through the Institute of Gas Engineers, of which I was for quite a long time President. I had not intended to take up too much of your Lordships' time to-day, but I should like to ask four questions of the Minister—three of which have already been raised by Lord Hawke and have been dealt with by Lord Stonham, which is rather frustrating for me. However, if I repeat them again it is only to try to elicit from the noble Lord who is to reply to the debate something more in regard to £s. d.
Of the three sources of energy which have been referred to to-day, namely, electricity, gas and atomic energy, gas is the most economical and we hope that it will become cheaper still. It is, however, important to remember where gas comes from. At present we are dependent largely on the old-fashioned method of producing gas, by the carbonisation of small-sized British coal. This is a costly process and, by the time the local gasometer has been filled, I would say, at a guess—and it is a pure guess, for it varies up and down the country—that on average it costs something in the region of s. to s. d. a therm. This process which we use to-day is rapidly being superseded by new methods of producing gas from petroleum or by natural gas.
We have heard from the noble Lord, Lord Hawke, about the frozen natural gas which is already being transported from Algeria. It comes from the Sahara, it is transported by pipe-line to the Algerian coast, and is brought to the Thames in two specially constructed insulated gas containers. The United States-British-French combine has just opened a 64 million dollar plant at Arzew for this purpose. The noble Lord, Lord Stonham, replied to that. But I should like to know whether it is proposed to increase that method of production and transportation, if we can get the gas, and how much more economic the price is going to be compared with production by carbonisation. I am under the impression that it costs about 7½ d. a therm, delivered to the Thames. I wonder whether the noble Lord who is to answer this debate can clarify that, and say how much more of the gas we are likely to get if we require it.
The new field in the Netherlands has already been referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Hawke, and the noble Lord, Lord Stonham, and I am very glad to hear that progress is being made with N.A.N. who are the Dutch group handling it. I read somewhere recently, that a pipe-line from the Netherlands to the British coast would not pay unless the gas could be delivered to this country at about 5½ d. to d. a therm, which seems to be a very low figure. I wonder whether any estimate has been made of what the gas would cost to come from the Netherlands if a pipe-line were built.
Also, we have heard about the fact that twenty of the great oil companies, as well as the Gas Council, have already commenced operations with a view to proving petroleum deposits close to the British coast, thus providing natural gas or petroleum oil from below the North Sea. I wonder whether the noble Lord can give us any idea what the gas is likely to cost per therm, if it is proved. Fourthly, certain other processes have been developed under which light petroleum distillates from our British refineries can be easily and cheaply converted into gas. I am told that the cost of that is about d. or d. a therm. Is that the right figure; and how much more gas are we likely to get from that means of production?
All these petroleum-based fuels are efficient and cheap to produce, and I believe that the British Gas Council has quite properly concentrated its attention on all four of these possibilities. It follows, of course, that coal gas will inevitably be displaced by petroleum or natural gases as their production, which is already well advanced, proceeds further. In that case, as the production of coal gas is reduced so the production of coke will likewise be reduced, and we may have to face a shortage of solid smokeless fuels for our new smokeless zones. That matter was also referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Stonham, but my hearing is a little imperfect and I could not quite hear whether or not there would be sufficient coke for that purpose. Obviously, difficulties would arise at this stage if a further strain were put on electricity and gas in the smokeless zones.
LORD STONHAM My Lords, it is not anticipated that there will be any shortage.
THE EARL OF DUDLEY My Lords, coke ovens in steelworks are also gradually being superseded by other methods, and it seems that the production of coke will eventually almost disappear, with a permanent adverse effect on our coal industry, owing to the loss of a large and long-established market for coal. But that point, again, has been referred to by the noble Lord.
Finally, there is the question of what might happen if this country were again to be engaged in a continental war, and we were relying on gas piped from abroad or brought here in a frozen state. But I suppose that, in any case, the questions that I have raised this afternoon would form only a very small part of a very large problem in a petroleum-starved country such as we are.

LORD CITRINE My Lords, my first words must be to congratulate very sincerely the noble Lord, Lord Hawke, upon introducing this subject this afternoon. His remarks were fair and temperate, and quite well informed. But the impression, which I have had almost from the time I first came into this House, is confirmed, about how careful one should be to avoid generalities, because it is almost certain that in some part of the House there will be an expert, or a series of experts, who will demolish the premises upon which a speaker has raised his case.
I cannot claim to be an expert, but I am one who has been associated with two of the three industries mentioned in the Motion. Both of them I found were efficient, and there was a degree of enthusiasm which was inherited by nationalisation. It was not evolved with nationalisation, but I hope that it was improved and stimulated, and it seemed to permeate the officials. The engineers and the commercial people believed in the service they were performing, and that made my ten years of chairmanship of the British Electricity Authority and its successor, the Central Electricity Authority, a very happy time indeed. Then I had five years as a part-time member of the Atomic Energy Authority. I found the engineers and scientists and members of the board with a progressive outlook, always wanting to embark upon some experiments or some new phase of work, but always restrained by the indirect but none the less effective shadow of the Treasury.
With gas I have nothing to do. I am a small consumer, and I try to be as small a consumer as is consistent with my household requirements. But I have long been an admirer of the ingenuity exercised by those who belong to that industry in fighting what I have long believed to be a losing battle—though I do not feel quite so confident of that to-day, in the light of recent developments which seem to have given the Gas Council, and the industry generally, a new lease of life. They are embarking upon a new era, the outcome of which I sincerely hope will prove successful; and I hope that it will provide an additional stimulus to the electricity industry further to increase its efficiency and so retain what is, I think, its well-deserved lead.
The noble Lord, Lord Hawke, performed a service in a direction which I think is particularly useful. I often writhed, when I was Chairman of the Electricity Council, at the perfunctory way in which the Reports of my own Board, and those with which I was associated, were dealt with in Parliament, not because of lack of interest but because of lack of opportunity fully and properly to investigate and examine the detailed matter set out in the Reports. The Annual Reports of all these bodies are literally packed with information. Indeed, I would say that the summaries of the Tables, particularly the Financial Tables, would repay study even by an expert accountant.
Infinitely fuller evidence of the activities of these Boards is given in those Annual Reports than is ever given by private companies in their reports. And in saying that I am not unmindful of the fact that a number of the larger companies produce admirable reports, usually well illustrated and quite expensive and attractive in their "get-up", which describe to a much greater extent to-day than was the case, say, 20 or 30 years ago the activities in which they are engaged, and the results of those activities. Those private companies have not the ordeal of periodical scrutiny by a Select Committee of another place. I think many of them would view with horror the prospect of anything of the kind, and would, to some extent regard it as a handicap. I say that because what is not realised is that when one is conscious that a periodical review will come along, or that some ad hoc committee may be appointed, a considerable number of people are looking over their shoulders and preparing data for when that time arrives. The freedom which one hoped for the public corporations has, in my opinion, been gradually whittled away over the years since nationalisation was introduced in 1947.
What should not be lost sight of is that, so far as gas and electricity are concerned, and to a lesser extent atomic energy, these industries are fiercely competitive. That is a curious thing to say about monopolies, but it is the fact that all of these industries are, in some sense or other, meeting fin the case of atomic energy, only at marginal points with the Central Electricity Board, but wholly in the case of the gas and electricity industries) open, keen and constant competition. I know more about electricity supply, of course, than I know about the other two; but, as this Motion is calling the attention of the House to the Reports, it may not be out of place to remind noble Lords who have looked at the Reports of the Electricity Council of some of the achievements.
There are now 16¾ million consumers of electricity in England and Wales; and, if we add the South of Scotland (which, when I was Chairman, up to 1925, at least, was served by the British Electricity Authority), there are over 18 million consumers of electricity to-day. That figure, of course, excludes the North of Scotland. The revenue for the industry last year was £912 million, and there was what I would call a surplus (and it was so called during my period), though it is now euphemistically described as a "balance of revenue", of some £70 million, after meeting huge sums for depreciation and interest.
An instruction was given by Parliamentary Resolution to the Electricity Boards to speed up the development of electricity on the farms and rural premises generally. A promise was given that 85 per cent. would be connected by 1963. But that promise was exceeded, and to-day some 92 per cent. of all the farms which are in any way eligible—some are too far away from the system to make it, by any sort of imagination, economic to serve them—are connected up. I should like your Lordships to think for a second of what that means. In pre-war days, some 3,000 farms a year were being connected to the public supply, either by private companies or by municipalities which had sufficiently large boundaries. That total was raised during my chairmanship—though not due to any effort of mine—to 15, 000 a year; and the price of electricity to the farmers and the farming communities is exactly the same as the Board's charge to their consumers in the various cities and towns and other urban areas.
The policy which was pursued by the electricity authorities in my day was to keep prices down. We believed that prices were rising too rapidly altogether throughout our community, and we thought we had some small contribution to make, as an Electricity Authority, by producing electricity as cheaply as we could and by selling it as cheaply as we could. We had a huge capital programme, and the stage was reached when the Government came along and said, "You must raise more of the capital you require from your revenues". In other words, we were required to engage in self-financing to a much greater extent than was traditional in the industry. We eventually agreed to about half of the total capital being raised from our revenues, and that policy has been continued since by all the Boards.
Noble Lords may remember the White Paper published by the Government which required the Boards to earn something like 12½ per cent. on their net assets. That position was reached last year, so that half the total investment comes from the Board's own resources. The remainder comes from borrowing from the Government, on which they have to pay the current rate of interest, which has been as high as 6¼ per cent., and, I rather think, at a particular period, 6¾ per cent., though I am not sure of the latter figure.
Reference has been made this afternoon by the noble Lord, Lord Stonham, to the capital cost of the power stations. Construction costs are going up, as they must go up in response to the various calls upon manufacturers. They went up by 44 per cent. over the ten-year period from 1954 to 1964: but the cost per kilowatt of the plant went down by 36 per cent. This, I think, is a remarkable achievement, and is the result of initiative and of a good deal of courage and boldness in installing untried generating sets—boilers out of all comparison, in size and capacity, with those that had been utilised before—and, by that means, getting the cost down.
The thermal efficiency of the industry, too, has been raised enormously. When I became Chairman it had been, I think, 2019 per cent., or, something of that kind; that is to say, of the heat extracted from the fuel, only some 20 per cent. was being turned into useful energy. Last year, according to this Annual Report of the Electricity Council, the average thermal efficiency was 27-67 per cent. Those of your Lordships who have looked over the Report may have said that this is not much of an increase because the previous year it was 27-44 per cent. These figures can conceal some very dramatic results. In my day on the Electricity Authority a saving of one-tenth of 1 per cent. on our then coal consumption meant a saving of 180, 000 tons of coal a year. With the greatly increased consumption of to-day it means far more than that. In the later days of my association with the industry I heard a chairman use the expression that there were no foreseeable limits to the development of electricity. I know that that sentiment was not shared by the officials of the Treasury who exhibited a pessimism that has long since been falsified.
My Lords, to turn to atomic energy, the noble Lord, Lord Sherfield, has given your Lordships various principles and a great deal of the details as to how the Authority is carrying on. I should like to remind your Lordships that the 1955 programme, which was published as a White Paper and debated in Parliament, was based on the premise that by the end of 1965 there would be insufficient coal available from the National Coal Board to provide our power stations with their requirements. Subsequently that estimate was very much revised. But the programme was based on the assumption of an impending coal shortage; and some day or other that shortage must arrive. That was the basis on which it was decided to go ahead with the 1955 programme. And I personally was in favour of that programme, although it could not, as it were, produce any economic results better than those we were then obtaining, or indeed anything like as good as those we were obtaining, from our conventional plant.
LORD SHERFIELD My Lords, if the noble Lord will allow me to interrupt, I was not so much criticising the size of the programme, or referring to the size of the programme, as referring to the dispersion of effort between different types.
LORD CITRINE Yes, my Lords, but I am not on that point, although I think I could put another side of the case. The point I was on was this. The first programme was a small one, 1,500 to 2,000 megawatts; that was the 1955 programme. It was received by the general Press almost like a fairy tale. Here was a new fuel coming along just at the time when we needed it, a fuel that was going to resolve all our problems. I knew that in many quarters suggestions were made that in five years' time or thereabouts no more conventional stations should be built; that all should be atomic energy stations. The enlarged programme that came along, it should be remembered, was propounded by the Conservative Government. It was not the programme of the British Electricity Authority or of its successor, the Central Electricity Generating Board. We knew very well that there was an element of risk in any programme of this size—technical risks and also financial risks. But we were told by the Government of the day, a Conservative Government, that they were most anxious for the enlarged pro- gramme, that the Cabinet themselves wanted us to go up to 5,000 or 6,000 megawatts; whereas our estimate of the maximum that we could safely produce from the economic viewpoint was some 3,500 megawatts.
I am not giving away any secrets, because all this was stated in the Report of the Select Committee which two years ago, I think, went into the electricity supply industry. The programme, of course, was slowed down subsequently and, as stated by my noble friend Lord Stonham, the target is not expected to be achieved until 1969. I want to say this about the Atomic Energy Authority. They have always loaded the dice against themselves; their estimates have always been on a very conservative basis—and that should please noble Lords opposite. Their expectations were always toned down and, from a promotional point of view, the worst possible case was put forward. A life of twenty years for the station! Neither Sir Roger—when one has sat at a table for five years calling a man "Sir Roger" it is difficult to remember that he is now the noble Lord, Lord Sherfield, and I apologise for that slip—nor anybody can say whether the life of the stations will be twenty years, thirty years or forty years. I have seen estimates of that kind from very reliable sources.
A Lord factor of 75 per cent. has been given for the calculations. Yet your Lordships have heard this afternoon that there are stations doing 87 per cent.—Chapel Cross station and Calder Hall station. Some have for a period of three months been up to 92 per cent. A high rate of interest has always been included in the estimate, higher than was available at the time the estimates were made. And the life of the fuel used, uranium, has always been underestimated. And very wisely so, because in dealing with experimental fuels it was wise to take very careful estimates of the results. But the 3,000-megawatt days which figured the estimates and on which these Magnox stations have been built has already proved to be well below what can be achieved. The Atomic Energy Authority and its officials have no doubt whatever as to the future. They believe—and they have solid evidence for this—that their advanced gas reactor is probably as efficient as any in any part of the world. I hardly like to risk quoting from memory the capital cost of that station, but I believe it was in the neighbourhood of £82 s. a kilowatt. But they are confident that an enlarged station can be built which would be able to generate electricity at 0-d. per unit.
Then there is the Dounreay fast reactor, now up to its full heat output. I do not think the world will ever realise what ingenuity has gone into the building of that plant. It was a most difficult job. Yet the predictions of the scientists and engineers have been fulfilled. Then they have two other types of reactors. They have the steam generating heavy water reactor which I believe will be a winner. I saw the plans of it, I heard discussions on it and I saw the estimates, and I am very much in favour of it, as I was of the 100 megawatt prototype. Your Lordships have heard from the noble Lord, Lord Sherfield, about the essential character of research. But it is a terrible thing for scientists who have embarked upon some plan for the future, perhaps for several years ahead, perhaps for a decade ahead, to find those plans frustrated by reason of a Government policy which feeds them only from year to year with the capital they desire. You cannot run an industry on that sort of basis successfully. So I hope it will be possible to give in extended measure the capital necessary to carry on an extended research by the Atomic Energy Authority.
So, my Lords, I reach my conclusion. These industries are, all of them, confident and efficient. They are vigorous and they are alert; they are viligant, they are enterprising and they are in competition—that competition which is so dear to the hearts of noble Lords opposite. They have an enthusiastic: belief in the commodity and the service they are rendering to the community. Speaking for myself, the happiest years of my life—and I have had many in other services—were those spent in public service in the nationalised industries.

EARL FERRERS My Lords, we are greatly indebted to my noble friend Lord Hawke for putting this Motion down and enabling the House to discuss this important, highly technical and complex subject. I am particularly glad that the noble Lord, Lord Citrine, took part in this debate. He says that he is not an expert; but when I know that he was Chairman of the British Electricity Authority for ten years and a member of the Atomic Energy Authority for five years, it makes a mere novice, such as I am, wish to regain his seat with quite unprecedented rapidity.
When I first saw the Motion which my noble friend put down, I was surprised at the scope and enormity of the debate which it depicted, because each of the industries which he mentions could well occupy your Lordships' attention for all of one afternoon and evening on its own. But it is right that in discussing the policy for the production of energy as a whole, we should discuss these methods together. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Stonham, that this question is the basis of all our existence. We talk gaily about increasing productivity and about building new roads, new houses and new factories, and take for granted that the power to light, heat and energise these places will be there for the asking. It is right that it should be there for the asking but it requires careful thought and long-range planning, and we have constantly to be prepared to alter our plans and our predictions if in any way they are shown to be inadequate.
It is necessary to know exactly what we are aiming for in a power policy and exactly what our principles should be. I suggest that, first, we must ensure that there is enough fuel of all kinds to meet the needs of British industry and the domestic consumer as a whole; secondly, that the price of the fuel must be such as not to put our industrialists out of line with their competitors; thirdly, that the supply must be secure, and fourthly, that there should be sufficient supplies to allow the consumer to choose the form in which he wants to take his energy, whether it is coal, gas, electricity or oil. To achieve these principles requires well-founded fuel industries which are modern and up to date in their technique and which are not subject to erratic and sudden changes of policy.
The first thing I would do is to impress upon Her Majesty's Government that, in developing our fuel policy, we should expand on a broad front and encourage every facet of these industries. We may well find that it is dangerous to develop excessively one form of power production at the expense of others, by spending too much of our national resources on the production of what looks like, at any one time, the cheapest form of fuel. If one type of fuel or, indeed, one type of production of a fuel were to be unduly cheapened, an excessive demand for this would be stimulated and we should find that much of our national resources was being spent on developing a particular branch of the fuel industry at the expense of the others. This does not mean that every effort should not be made to encourage the cheap production of fuel. But, when we consider the investment to be placed in industry as a whole, we should keep a balance, I would suggest, between the various methods of production and types of fuel, expanding where possible and encouraging new methods, but not necessarily at the expense of the more conventional, and equally not discarding too quickly an industry or method of production within an industry which appears at the moment to be not so economically successful as some of its rivals. At the same time, we must not tolerate out-of-date methods.
Of all the power industries, the electricity industry takes by far the largest proportion of capital investment—some £650 million, of which the taxpayer provides about half. So Her Majesty's Government have a big and loaded interest in the electricity industry. But this enormous amount of capital expenditure is in order to ensure that our electricity supplies are adequate for the future. As the noble Lord, Lord Stonham, pointed out, our capacity is only just within the bounds of the demand—in fact, it is not quite within the bounds. Everyone has the right to expect in cold weather and in hard winter to be able to call for more fuel. Bearing in mind that electricity demand increases by some 10 per cent. a year and that it takes some seven years for a new power station to become operative after the decision to build it has been taken, long-term planning must be accurate and must not fall down.
We have heard a great deal from the Chancellor of the Exchequer of how he is going to review Government expenditure in order to counteract the state of affairs which at the moment exists in the economic sphere. There are a num- ber of questions I would ask the noble Lord, Lord Hobson. Do Her Majesty's Government intend to cut the investment programme of the electricity industry? If not, will the noble Lord give an assurance that this will not be cut? What, in fact, are Her Majesty's Government's proposals for the future building of power stations? How many stations are going to be built, when are they going to be built, and where? By what methods are these to be powered? Are we going to see more use of nuclear energy or are we going to continue to see them powered by steam? And, if by steam, how is that to be generated: by oil, by coal or by pulverised fuel?
I was interested to hear the noble Lord, Lord Stonham, say that for future nuclear stations it had not been decided whether to use the British advanced gas-cooled reactor or the American water moderated reactor. And I was delighted to hear the noble Lord, Lord Sherfield, put so clearly the advantages of nuclear energy and of the British system. I should like to endorse very much his remarks when he said that the Central Electricity Generating Board has the duty of providing electricity at the cheapest possible rate, but that this should not be the sole criterion in deciding what type of reactor should be used. If, indeed, the Government decide in the end that the American water-moderated system should be used, I hope that they will bear in mind the possible bridling of research that that decision might make inevitable on those who are already engaged in the designing and perfecting of the advanced gas-cooled reactors.
LORD STONHAM My Lords, may I interrupt the noble Earl? Nothing that I said should be interpreted in any way as suggesting that the American reactor was going to be selected. Indeed, I indicated the exact terms on which tenders have been invited.
EARL FERRERS I did not think that for one moment, and I was not aware that I gave that impression. If I did, I apologise. I accept entirely the fact that the noble Lord said that this decision has not been arrived at. The point I am trying to make is that when the Government come to make that decision they should have regard to the fact that production of the cheapest form of electricity is not necessarily the sole criterion on which the decision should be taken.
It is expected that nuclear power stations should be able by the early 'seventies to compete in cost with conventional power stations for the production of electricity. As noble Lords have already pointed out, the capital cost of erecting nuclear power stations is far in excess of that of erecting conventional power stations, although the running cost is considerably lower. We have seen in the last five years, since the construction of the Berkeley Station, that the capital cost per kw. of capacity has dropped from something like £177 to £106 at the Sizewell plant. What I should like to know (I do not know whether the noble Lord, Lord Hobson, can answer this) is whether it is anticipated that the capital cost of building nuclear power stations in the future is still likely to decrease on anything like the scale which it has in the past, and whether, when we have arrived at the point where nuclear power stations can compete with conventional power stations for the production of electricity, it is anticipated that the nuclear-powered system will become cheaper, or whether it will remain merely competitive.
In all industries the larger the unit of manufacture the cheaper tends to be the end product. This is so with electricity. There are the vast 500 mw. generating sets to which the noble Lord, Lord Citrine, referred; and, of course, they produce electricity more cheaply than the smaller sets. That is a substantial argument in favour of having them. But when one of these monsters breaks down, the chaos that results is considerably greater than if the set were of a smaller dimension. Therefore I wonder whether the noble Lord can throw any light on what might be expected in the future. Are we likely to see more of these large sets, or are they likely to be smaller—or bigger?
Continuity in supply is vastly important in the electricity industry, as in any fuel industry, and will become more so in the future as industry depends more on electricity and as the consequences of breakdowns become ever greater. One of the greatest causes of failure in the electricity industry is the process of reducing the electricity from high voltage to low voltage. This is of a technical nature. When this happens, frequently the fuses tend to blow one after the other—what is technically and rather graphically described as "cascading". This is a problem of some magnitude and is a great cause of the breakdown in electricity supplies. I wonder whether it is possible for more to be spent on research into this particular aspect, so that the continuity of supplies can be more readily available. What I should like to know, also, is what are the Government's plans—if, indeed, they have any—to deal with the situation caused by the fact that many of the underground cables in our big cities, and particularly in the West End of London, are rapidly becoming too small, in view of the vastly increased demand put upon them by consumers requiring more electricity. Is it intended that these should be replaced with bigger cables of adequate size, or is it intended that they should continue to be overloaded, with all the trouble that this causes?
My Lords, these are real problems which the electricity industry has to face, and problems which become the more acute when electricity is compared with any other form of fuel, and particularly with gas. In this connection, I wish to touch upon one very real disadvantage to electricity when compared with gas, and it is one that is best illustrated by two advertisements that one frequently sees, particularly in agricultural papers. One is by the Central Electricity Generating Board which depicts a person placing a pylon in a field or on the landscape and which says at the bottom: "Where would you put it?" The other is issued by the Gas Council, and depicts a field of barley growing quite beautifully, and underneath it says: "Last year a gas main was laid under here". I do not want to labour the point, because it was discussed some three weeks ago, but this is a problem; and I feel that much more money should be spent on research to see whether it is not possible to lay underground cables more cheaply and more effectively. It is done in other countries, and it should be done in this country, if our ever-depleted countryside is not going to become bogged down with a mass of wires. I suppose one cynical observation might be that all praise should be given to the Gas Council for not inflicting upon us a mass of monster black pipes, travelling over our heads about 100 feet high all over the country. I hope the Government will do all they can to see that more research is put into laying cables underground.
One of the disadvantages which electricity has is the fact that the capital cost of making gas in the new oil-reforming plants is only 25 per cent. of the capital cost of making electricity. The gas industry, of course, has revolutionised itself from being an almost defunct relic of the Victorian era into a modern, highly efficient, high competitive, highly productive industry, all in a matter of seven to eight years. There is in operation, as has been mentioned already, the very ambitious scheme of bringing Algerian methane to this country; and there are many other possibilities, such as methane from Holland, and the drilling for gas in the North Sea, not to mention the cheapest method of gas production, which is that from oil. At the moment, only about 6 per cent. of our energy requirements in this country comes from gas, whereas in the United States the amount is 30 per cent. So obviously, whilst one does not want to draw too close an analogy, there are vast possibilities for gas to fulfil a large part, and an increasing part, of our energy requirement over the next decade or so. But if gas is to be used on a greatly increased scale, one of the problems that is bound to arise is the question of storage. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Hobson, will be able to tell us precisely what are the Government's views about underground storage. Will they permit it? Indeed, will they encourage it; and, if so, what will be the scale of the investment?
In all these considerations over the gas industry one must remember one significant fact, and that is that the gas industry has no built-in monopoly of any kind. There is nothing that can be done by gas that cannot be done by some other fuel. This means that it is essential, if the fullest use is to be made of all the potentials open to the gas industry, that the greatest freedom of choice must be allowed in the methods of gas making and in the use of raw materials.
The answer, I should have thought, is that each of these industries, whether gas or electricity should be given a great deal of rein so that they can develop whatever technique suits them best. We hear a great deal about planning, particularly from noble Lords opposite. Overall planning is certainly necessary. We must plan what our energy requirements will be for the future. We must plan the investment. But replacing enterprise with planning could well be a disaster, and I cannot help recalling the words in the Labour Party's pamphlet which I thought was rather offensively entitled as Twelve Wasted Years. It said: In spite of representation from the coal industry, the gas industry is being allowed to go ahead with the production of gas from oil. These are the complications resulting from making two public authorities compete, when a positive programme of co-operation (for example, siting Lurgi plants on coalfields and distributing the high pressure gas by pipe-line) could satisfy both the nation's fuel requirements and the stability of the industries concerned. My Lords, I wonder whether that is really the view of the Labour Party now that they have had a few weeks' experience of government. I wonder whether they really believe that it is wrong for the Gas Council to make gas from oil, even though it is cheaper, just because they might be damaging the coal industry by not using the other alternative of coal. I wonder, indeed, whether the new Minister of Technology would not prefer to make a meal of those words, and admit that it is by being competitive that these new processes have been evolved for the benefit of the gas industry and the country as a whole. We cannot afford to have doctrinaire views about essential industries. The main thought should be so to set the conditions that each industry can make the best possible use of the resources at its disposal and give of its best to the nation.
If we are entering a new era where modern technology is to be released to play a full part, I ask the noble Lord, Lord Hobson, to explain what are the Government's views about the production of gas. Are they going to insist that the Gas Council should make its gas from coal, even though gas can be produced at two-thirds the cost from methane, and at less than half the cost from oil? Or are they going to sanction and bless an increased investment in the gas industry to make the best use of the most up-to-date and modern forms of production? These are real problems and I, for one, would be the first to say that they are by no means easy of solution. But they are problems on which we in this House wish to have the Government's views, and I hope the noble Lord will not be content to brush your Lordships off with the answer that these matters are under review. The Government must have an opinion, and I invite the noble Lord, Lord Hobson, to give us that opinion.
We want to know what is the Government's intention with regard to capital investment in these basic industries. In this regard I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Hobson, will give a clear and concise indication on one other point of great importance. In April, 1961, the Government published a White Paper entitled, The Financial and Economic Obligations of the Nationalised Industries, in which clear objectives were stated with regard to the finances of the nationalised industries—for instance, that surpluses should be at least sufficient to cover deficits over a five-year period, and that allowance should be made in the accounts of the industries for interest and depreciation on capital. Do Her Majesty's Government adhere to the principles as laid down in this White Paper?
I am not asking these questions of the noble Lord to score a few debating points, but because I genuinely want to find out what the Government propose to do. We have had a change in Government—mistakenly in my view—and we have had new minds put into the top positions: not necessarily be;: ter minds, not necessarily worse minds; but fresh minds. What we want to know is what view these minds have taken, and whether the views are the same as they were when they were in Opposition; for if they are, we are in for some surprises. But it may be that they have been mellowed after a period, even a slight one, of responsibility. But whatever decisions may be taken, we must remember that the results of these decisions will not be made effective over the next year, or the next two years: one may not see them for the next five, six or seven years. Therefore the important thing is that these decisions should be as near right as we can get them.

LORD HOBSON My Lords, I think we shall all agree that we have had a most interesting and informative debate, and we are grateful to the noble Lord. Lord Hawke, for raising this very important question of a fuel policy, which is of paramount importance to the economy of the nation and the wellbeing of all of us. In your Lordships' House we are exceedingly fortunate in having among our Members noble Lords who have had a lifetime of service either in the gas or electricity supply industry. One has only to look back this afternoon at the contributions that have been made by the noble Lord, Lord Wolverton, the noble Earl, Lord Dudley (who has associations with the gas industry), the noble Lord, Lord Sherfield (who was a prominent Chairman of the Atomic Energy Authority) and the noble Lord, Lord Citrine, who was probably the founder of the Central Electricity Board, over which he presided so successfully for ten successive years.
It will be my object this evening, in the time at my disposal, to endeavour to answer seriatim the questions that have been raised—and they are many. There may be sins of omission and commission, but in that event I will write to the noble Lords, and give them, I trust, not an evasive reply but the answer which, though they may not like it, they perhaps require. When we are dealing with fuel and power (and I do not make a political point here) one cannot help remembering that these industries, coal, gas and electricity are very successful nationalised industries; and not even the present Opposition had any intention, while in power, of denationalising any of them. One of the advantages of these nationalised fuel industries, as has been pointed out by several noble Lords this afternoon, is that they are competitive one against the other; and that is one of the reasons why we have such successful fuel industries.
The noble Lord, Lord Hawke, in so far as he dealt with the coal industry, dealt with something—and I am not making a debating point here—which was outside the terms of this Motion. The noble Lord raised certain specific questions on this aspect, and I have been successful, I trust, in getting the required information. But the whole gravamen of his speech was that he was asking for a national fuel policy. It is precisely the intention of the present Government to supply one. But this cannot come about overnight. I think that anyone who is devoid of any political aims would agree that prima facie this is something that is absolutely essential and vital to the economy of our country. We shall endeavour to achieve this national fuel policy, but, as I said, it cannot be done overnight. I am very pleased to know that we shall have the support of the noble Lord, Lord Hawke on this policy.
The noble Lord, Lord Hawke, raised one specific query: was the oil position secure? With respect, I think he answered his own question. Apart from the resources that are now known and are operated, there are, of course, vast deposits of oil in another part of the Commonwealth which are largely untapped. We know that they are there, and I think we can say with firmness that the oil position is secure.
The noble Lord was also concerned with over-capacity of power-generating plants. Of course, it depends on what is meant by over-capacity. There must always be adequate spare plant, but engineers may differ as to what it is necessary to regard as spare plant. But with the whole development of the Grid, and the development now of the Super-Grid, the amount of spare capacity which is required is less than heretofore. Certainly, I think it is safe to say that at the present moment there is not spare capacity, because in certain winter conditions we should need every kilowatt we can generate. But the aim, as my noble friend Lord Stonham has pointed out, is that eventually we should have spare capacity which is considered by the engineers to be adequate.
The noble Lord, Lord Hawke, also raised the question of off-peak loading and the question of tariffs. This is a very complicated question, but I shall deal with it. I assure noble Lords that I am not dodging this question, which was also raised particularly by the noble Lord, Lord Ferrier. But I can say straight away to the noble Lord, Lord Hawke, that the question of off-peak tariffs is a matter which is always being considered both by the Central Electricity Generating Board and by the Area Boards.
My Lords, at the outset of his speech, the noble Lord, Lord Hawke, raised the question of coal output. Coal output was 195 million tons for the year ending March, 1964. Future prospects of the coal industry in relation to the co-ordinated policy for fuel are being reviewed by the Minister of Power in collaboration with the noble Lord, Lord Robens, and his colleagues. Until the new review is completed it would be unwise to make any predictions about the level of coal output in future years, certainly not as far ahead as 1975, the year mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Hawke.
I come back to electricity. The noble Lord, Lord Hawke, raised the question of the cost per unit in conventional power stations and the cost at Wylfa. I do not think this figure has been given. I am taking the Wylfa atomic power station, because this is the largest and, we trust, the most modern. The cost per unit at conventional stations is 0-d. per unit and the cost per unit at Wylfa is 0-d. It is interesting to note, and I think I ought to give this information here, that the output of Wylfa station will be of the order of 1,180 mw.
LORD HAWKE Before the noble Lord leaves that point, will he confirm that these figures for Wylfa are, as I believe, based on what is termed the conservative basis of a 20-year life and 75 per cent. availability?
LORD HOBSON That is perfectly true. I think the noble Lord, Lord Citrine, answered that point. I think we all agree.
LORD HAWKE I was merely seeking information.
LORD HOBSON At present, on what is known as ground assessments, it is on the basis of a 20 to 25-year life. They may last thirty years like the conventional station. Quite frankly, the answer to this is that we just do not know. We are in the field of a modern and new science. Let us take pride that it is the British who have developed it. I just cannot categorically answer that specific question and, frankly, I do not think anybody, even the experts, the engineers and the physicists can give a direct answer to it.
LORD HAWKE The noble Lord has got me mixed up. Nobody is asking the noble Lord to say what the life of these stations is. We are only asking him to say on what life these particular figures are based; that is all; and the noble Lord has answered twenty years.
77
LORD HOBSON These things are based on a 20 to 25-year life.
LORD HAWKE There is a big difference between 20 and 25 years.
LORD HOBSON I cannot be adamant about this. I am not prepared to be committed, but the noble Lord can take it as twenty years.
I now come to the question that has been raised by the noble Lord, Lord Wolverton, about the types of reactor and, in particular, about the boiling water reactor. The fact of the matter is that at the present moment there is no British made boiling water reactor. On the other hand, the noble Lord, Lord Wolverton, is entirely wrong in saying that the Central Electricity Generating Board have been given permission to import an American reactor. That is not so. The type of reactor that we are to have in the future has not yet been decided. Indeed, the policy of Her Majesty's Government at the present moment is precisely the same policy as was enunciated in April, 1964. I believe it was debated in your Lordships' House in July, 1964, just before the Summer Recess. It is made perfectly clear in paragraph 6 of the White Paper.
What the Central Electricity Generating Board have done—and I paraphrase their words—is to ask for tenders for an advanced gas-cooled reactor and also for a boiling water type reactor. The question of choice has got to be made. Obviously Sir Christopher Hinton, who was then the Chairman of the Central Electricity Generating Board, wanted to be absolutely sure which was going to be the most economic, because it was part of his statutory duty to provide a reliable source of energy to Britain at the lowest possible price. This is a question ultimately of prudence, and this is precisely what is going to take place. Tenders are being called for and a decision will have to be made. As the noble Lord, Lord Sherfield, mentioned, that decision will have to be made in conjunction with the Central Electricity Generating Board and the Atomic Energy Authority, who together will make the reappraisal. But the final decision will be with Her Majesty's Government, and, of course, we shall await the outcome of those deliberations.
78
LORD WOLVERTON My Lords, may I interrupt the noble Lord for a moment? I quite understood, because I myself took part in that debate which the noble Lord mentioned, that the boiling water reactor is not made in this country, but I thought that the Generating Board were anxious to try one out, and therefore would ask the British manufacturers to give a quotation for it, which, as I understood it, they would have had to do under licence from American firms. If they had given a quotation for that against the advanced gas-cooled reactor it would, of course, be under licence from America. Is that not right?
LORD HOBSON That is perfectly true because, as I said a few seconds ago, we do not make a pressurised water reactor. Therefore, we should only hope—and I am sure it would be the policy of Her Majesty's Government—that it would be made here in Britain under licence. I only hope that a time will rapidly approach when we ourselves have a successful pressurised water reactor.
EARL FERRERS My Lords, before the noble Lord leaves that point—which is rather important—as he said the final decision would be taken by Her Majesty's Government, can he give an assurance that the cheapness of the production of electricity will not be the sole criterion by which the final judgment will be made?
LORD HOBSON In matters like this, the Government will obviously have to take into consideration every factor regarding the reactor; its cost, whether it is made in Britain, and the expected ultimate price per unit. I think those are the main points that were raised by the noble Lord, Lord Wolverton.
I now come to the questions raised by the noble Lord, Lord Sherfield. He is, of course, a very eminent ex-Chairman of the Atomic Energy Authority, and he certainly made a very authoritative statement. In looking at The Second Nuclear Power Programme the Government will obviously take into account every consideration which he has raised, particularly the questions of safety. We must, I think, pay a tribute here to the work of the Atomic Energy Authority, in conjunction with the Central Electricity Generating Board, in regard to the safety of modern atomic power stations; touch wood! we have had no major trouble whatever, and this is a very fine record.
As to what the programme will be, the White Paper has stressed that The Second Nuclear Power Programme will have to be flexible. Obviously, we cannot go ahead with new nuclear power stations until such time as we have assessed which is the most suitable reactor, whether advanced gas-cooled or pressurised-water. The noble Lord mentioned the question of the relations between the Boards. I know there was a great deal of talk in the Press about alleged trouble between the Atomic Energy Authority and the Central Electricity Generating Board. Frankly, I do not think that many people believed this; but of course it made a good story. When these questions are being discussed in an atmosphere such as that, I always feel like saying that there is complete harmony only in the graveyard, and there is not much life there. Here very important technical questions had to be discussed. But relations between the Central Electricity Generating Board and the Atomic Energy Authority at the present moment are most amicable. I do not think paragraph 6 of The Second Nuclear Power Programme can be said to be a compromise settlement; it was nothing of the sort. It was a settlement which was agreed as the noble Lord, Lord Derwent (I think on July 20), made abundantly clear when we addressed your Lordships' House.
The noble Lord, Lord Sherfield, made a very important point about using Capenhurst for enriching uranium. I think that is something which will have to be borne in mind. I am sure Her Majesty's Government will pay particular attention to that point. If there is to be a run down of fissionable material for war purposes, and if we can use the plant for enriching uranium for use in more advanced reactors, that is of considerable advantage indeed.
I come now to the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Ferrier. He referred to paragraph 64 of the last Report of the Electricity Council, which dealt with the effect of bulk supply tariff and the high cost associated with the expansion of their capital programmes. This arises from the policy of the previous Government when they set financial objectives for the nationalised industries in the 1961 White Paper on Financial and Economic Obligations of the Nationalised Industries. This was issued in the form of a Command Paper, No. 1337. The nationalised fuel and power industries, for which the Minister of Power is responsible, will continue to work for financial objectives agreed from time to time between the Government and the Board.
Then the noble Lord raised the question of what was being done in case we had a very severe winter. For example, should we have auxiliary generating stations? I am very pleased to inform him that the Central Electricity Generating Board are at the present moment well ahead with the programme for gas turbines to cover these emergencies. It will be essential for these difficult periods should we get a very severe winter. I think that answer will satisfy the noble Lord. It is a very important point and it is one on which action has already been taken; this is not a question of hope deferred.
I now pass to the question of rural electrification. My noble friend Lord Citrine saved me a lot of work, because I think he answered the noble Lord. It is running now at 92 per cent., which is a marvellous achievement, and even in the most difficult areas of Merseyside and North Wales a figure of about 89 per cent. has been reached. This is a wonderful achievement of which the C.E.G.B. can be very proud indeed. I think we ought to pay a special tribute to the Area Boards who deal with this as a matter of top priority. There are going to be very few areas without electrical power within the next year.
LORD FERRIER My Lords, I agree that the record is very remarkable and excellent. I think that some parts of Scotland have the most extensive rural electrification in the world. What I was worrying about was the cost to the consumer, now that saturation has nearly been reached. Is proper attention paid to the social side of this matter, and the last few connections to be made, which are the most difficult?
LORD HOBSON Unquestionably. I can categorically answer that such considerations are continually being looked at. The noble Lord dealt with the question of tariffs, and raised the matter again by way of interjection. At the beginning of his speech he really put in a plea for higher tariffs, because he was questioning the wisdom of having non-base Lord stations to come in at peak periods. He was arguing whether they were really necessary and what effect they had on the cost. That is as I understood the noble Lord, and I took a full note. Obviously, we want the most equitable tariff as between industrial and domestic consumers. One cannot be dogmatic about this question—conditions vary from region to region because of geographical positions—but with the transmission of electricity of high voltage it has become of less and less importance. I can assure noble Lords on both sides that the question of tariffs for electricity—particularly for off-peak periods, and that is when we want people to consume eleotricity—and the question of space heating storage is continually being looked at.
It is not an easy problem. It was a problem in my early days in municipal electricity. I am sure the noble Lord, Lord Wolventon, is perfectly well aware of this. It is not dodging the issue and ducking for cover when I assure noble Lords of that, and I am prepared at any time to face a debate on electricity tariffs. I must stress the fact that this is a most difficult problem indeed, because of the nature of the industry where it has to meet this heavy demand at peak periods only. If it is coupled with high domestic demand, the cost really is increased. It is a question of alternating the Lord factor. If we can get more people to go in for space heating storage and so reduce the peak load, the question of tariffs will always be to their advantage.
LORD FERRIER My Lords, the noble Lord misunderstood something I said, but we need not worry now; we can talk about it on some other occasion.
LORD HOBSON We shall have a nice, pleasant chat about the whole problem.
Now I come to the question raised by the noble Earl, Lord Dudley, on priorities in regard to nationalisation and the question of gas. He said that gas was the most economical form of power. It is, in certain places, but not all the time. So far as the future of the gas industry is concerned, I think that the previous Government, and certainly the Gas Council, seeing that these nationalised boards are free from political interference in day-to-day management, have done a valuable job. There has been the construction of the two tankers to import methane, the purification plants at Canvey Island, and to-night we can probably look forward to burning gas from Algiers.
So far as the question of importing natural gas from Holland is concerned, I must ask noble Lords not to be too pressing on this matter, because negotiations are at the present moment taking place. Obviously, if the Gas Council can get Dutch gas at a price which is worth looking at, they will. They are progressive. Their sales since 1950 have gone up considerably. It is a dynamic industry, and any source of supply of natural gas that we can use, we shall use. Of course, we cross our fingers and hope that the explorations that are now taking place in the North Sea will show that there is a continuation of the natural gas field from Groningen in Holland.
I now come to the speech of my noble friend Lord Citrine. I should like to pay tribute to his speech. He gave us a short but comprehensive history of the industry. It is one that he may look back on with great pride. It has certainly been a success story, and in his retirement he must, I think, feel proud. It is an industry that has done well for the nation. It is a progressive industry. So far as conventional and atomic stations are concerned, I think we can say that we are just in front of any other country. I do not think that any other country has the edge on us, and this is largely due to the drive of the original Chairman of the Board, Lord Citrine.
I now come to the specific questions—they were almost frightening—of the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, who wound up on behalf of the Opposition. I shall be able to answer some of them, but not all. I can give him a categorical assurance that we are keeping the same investment programme—namely, £673 million for electricity and £100 million for gas. As to what the future will be for next year, considerable deliberations are taking place at the present moment. It is quite early in the lifetime of even this dynamic Government to say precisely what the figure of vast sums of capital expenditure are going to be in the industries. No doubt there are ways and means open to the noble Earl from which he can ascertain as time goes by if he thinks we have been rather slow in coming forward. Noble Lords will no doubt take the usual Parliamentary steps to find out. My intervention here is to give the noble Earl a categorical assurance that it is the status quo ante that prevails at the moment. That is not to say that it will continue as such, because obviously we have certain hopes.
He dealt with the methods of power. There are no prejudices in these matters. I cannot tell him what the conventional stations are going to do—whether they are going to burn oil, pulverised fuel or coal. That really is a question of day-to-day management for the Central Electricity Generating Board. It may be that at certain stations in the North or in Scotland it is more advantageous to burn coal. There may be certain other stations where oil is preferred. This is entirely a question of day-to-day management, and I certainly cannot give the noble Earl an assurance of that kind, any more than I could with regard to the future atomic programme, other than what I have stated.
He said that he hoped that there would be a decrease of cost for atomic power stations. That is already being brought about. The capital cost per kilowatt of Wylfa will be less than that of the existing atomic power stations. The lower we can get the capital costs the more competitive will they become with the conventional stations. But I must enter a caveat here. It is not fair to say, or to give the impression, that only the atomic engineers are making headway. The development that has taken place in steam pressures and the temperatures of superheat in my time has been tremendous; and we might even, to use a phrase which I detest using, get a break-through from the conventional engineers. Those are all things for which, in a progressive industry, we have always to be on our guard.
Then the noble Earl dealt with the question of breakdowns and having all the eggs in one basket. The fact of the matter is that with the super and high Super-Grid there is less chance of getting a flatout if the 500-megawatt set goes down. Judging from what happened in the past, from one's own experience, the tendency is bound to be for sets to get larger. It is not so many years ago that Battersea was the show-place of Europe on 100, 000 kilowatt sets—and somebody told me they had chromium plated rails there because there were so many visitors coming to see it. I think one can safely say that the tendency will be that we shall have to keep to 500, 000 kilowatts for a little while, but that, progress being what it is, output will get larger.
The noble Earl dealt with the difficult question of cascading. That is a problem which occurs quite frequently in times of bad weather, where short-circuits occur on the switch gear, the switches drop and certain sections are put out; and of course, the higher the voltage stepped down to 240 volts domestic supply, the more difficult it becomes to ascertain which one has crept out. But this is a matter which the engineers are studying. So far as strengthening the distributing network is concerned, this is going on all the time. We know that there are certain black spots in the Metropolis, but the London Electricity Board is doing what it can, allowing for the capital resources at its disposal, to strengthen the distributing network. This arises from the terrific demand for electricity which is continually taking place.
I have endeavoured to answer most of the points that have been raised. If I have not succeeded, certainly my right honourable friend or myself will write to any noble Lord on any point that we may find, having read the Official Report to-morrow, we have omitted to deal with. I want to conclude by saying a word on the future of atomic stations. This is an interesting subject. It is something to which (one almost hesitates to use the words) fashionable attention is paid to-day. Point one is that tenders are due in February. Point two is the type of reactor, whether advanced gas-cooled or boiling-water type, that will be decided. An assessment will be made by the Central Electricity Generating Board and the Atomic Energy Authority and the Government's decision will be final.
I think the whole House was pleased to have the assurance that should there be an interim period, so far as the work of the consortia is concerned this question is being actively considered. On the other hand, all consortia are hopeful. I fail to see why they should not secure contracts from abroad, because our atomic power stations, which have been proven, are first-class. The difficulties are certainly not those of design; they are certainly not due to the failure of the skill of our engineers or technicians; and if we can export atomic power stations abroad nobody will be more pleased than the consortia, on the one hand, and Her Majesty's Government, on the other.
I will conclude by congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Hawke, for initiating this most interesting and informative debate. I am sure that even those noble Lords who know the industry from A to Z cannot have helped but glean some information from listening to the debate to-day.

LORD HAWKE My Lords, I should like to thank "the usual channels" for their permission to bring forward this debate at this time, and noble Lords for taking part. We have heard a major speech from the noble Lord, Lord Sherfield, which I hope will be studied at home and abroad where there are chances of export orders for atomic energy plant. With those few words, I beg leave to withdraw my Motion.
LORD TODD rose to call attention to the state of technological development in relation to the universities and to industry; and to move for Papers. The noble Lord said: My Lords, perhaps I might begin by explaining what I mean by "technology", a word that has been applied with a great number of different meanings. To-day I want to use the word "technology" in what I would call the modern sense; that is to say, I am speaking of the application of the scientific method and the results of scientific research to the solution of industrial problems. The term "technology", as I am going to use it, covers, of course, applied science in general, and in particular it includes engineering. I would ask your Lordships to note at the outset that in certain of its aspects at least it is not, save in its economic objectives, clearly distinguishable from what generally passes for pure science or pure scientific research.
The fact is that in the world to-day a country lives by its technology, by its success in translating the results of scientific research through design and manufacture into products which we can sell in the face of increasingly severe international competition. This is particularly so in a country like our own, which is small in area, which is overpopulated and which has not much in the way of natural resources. We simply cannot live by happily exporting the crops which we grow in our soil or the minerals which happen to lie underneath the soil. Indeed, the situation is rather similar to one which I found myself discussing with the late Sir Henry Tizard just after the war, when he said to me, "We have not got money, so we shall just have to use our brains".
The trouble is that we have not used our brains enough, for technological backwardness is still far too common in many areas of industry in this country. We have to realise that we can keep our place as an industrial Power only by continued technological innovation. I agree that matters are better than they were a few years ago, but the rate of improvement, to my mind, is far too slow. This is a matter in which time is very definitely not on our side. Some other countries seem to innovate more rapidly and more frequently than we do; and one can get witness of that in the remarkable rise in industrial productivity in such countries as Western Germany and Japan. Why is this so, and what can we do about it? These are the questions that I hope we are going to discuss this afternoon.
In speaking about innovation in industry, I know full well, as do other noble Lords, that the barriers to technological innovation in industry are not by any means all scientific or technological: many of the most important are financial or social barriers. Innovation involves capital risk, and firms are not likely to venture their capital without at least reasonable prospect of an adequate return in the relatively short term. Again, innovation is liable to involve what can be awkward change for the individual. Particularly in the old-established, craft-based industries, innovation may affect the internal hierarchy of skills in the industry. It may also affect local social patterns; and for these reasons one finds that it tends to be opposed by workers and management alike. It also calls for first-class management—a matter that has recently been discussed in your Lordships' House, on a Motion introduced by the noble Lord, Lord Alport, when new plans for managerial education were under review.
On that subject, beyond stating that I think management education is important, I will say nothing except that I very much agree with the remarks made at the time by my noble friend Lord Bowden: that we must be very careful, in trying to develop managerial education, that we do not think we can simply lift an institution from the United States or any other country, dump it over here, and expect to get the same results as have been obtained by that institution in the country of its origin. But, in the last analysis, since innovation depends on the application of new or existing scientific knowledge, it seems to me quite obvious that a strong and continuing research and development effort in industry is a necessary prerequisite to it.
Examples of the way in which a continued effort pays off can be seen if one looks at those industries, for example, the chemical industry, or the electronics industry, in which the maintenance of a considerable research and development effort is common. These industries—one might call them the modern, science-based industries—are, of course, industries which live by innovation and are usually thoroughly alert to the possibilities in this respect. It is characteristic of these industries that they have for the most part grown up alongside, and in intimate contact with, the science on which they rest. What is more, they usually have a very strong technical element in their management.
I would not say that everything is perfect in this group of industries. There are still in it firms that ought to do more research and development than they do; some of them are inclined to rest a little too easily on defence contracts. But still, by and large, they are alert to possibilities. Trouble arises in them now and again, of course, when a situation arises in which existing knowledge suggests a possibility of a major advance, possibly in the rather long term, but where to undertake the work necessary would be beyond the resources of, or perhaps too great a capital risk for, any one firm in the industry; or in some cases, as for example the development of new methods of power generation, possibly even for a combination of firms within the industry. In cases like that, I believe that a very good case can be made for Government intervention, because in the national interest the Government can, or ought to, take a longer view of matters than an individual firm can.
It was as far back as 1953 that the Advisory Council on Scientific Policy first proposed the use of development con- tracts in civil industry, yet not very much has happened. To date, the amount that has been done in the way of development contracts in civil industry is small; the sums involved are not large, and there are not many cases. One begins to wonder whether this really is the answer, or whether the trouble is merely that the idea has not been pursued vigorously enough. Similarly, the National Research Development Corporation, which was expected to have a considerable part to play in technological development in industry, has worked extremely hard, but I would not say that it has made an enormous impact.
I was very pleased to see, in a statement made in the other place last week, that the Ministry of Technology and the Government at large propose to make a vigorous effort in the direction of improving technology in industry. But I hope that they have some more ideas than simply development contracts with the National Research Development Corporation. I have for years pushed the idea that it would be well worth while making the experiment, in cases of the type I have mentioned, of the Government taking a share in the equity of an industry: they might, say, form a joint company in which the Government were responsible, as well as the industry itself, for part of the fixed assets. I hope that I am correct in assuming, from a reply made in another place by the Prime Minister yesterday in response to a question, that some such idea is indeed in the Government's mind. I believe that it would be well worth while taking a chance, at least, and trying one or two experiments on this principle of sharing the equity.
The toughest problem, of course, so far as industry is concerned, is not presented by these science-based industries; it is presented by what I call the mature or traditional industries of this country—industries like textiles, shipbuilding, construction, metal shaping, cutting and so on. These are in general, of course, craft-based industries, and in their growth science has played, and I am afraid still is playing, very little part. It is true that there are regular small innovations in these industries, but it is rather striking that where major innovation has occurred in them it has usually come through force majeure from outside, or by actual invasion of the traditional industry by a new science-based industry. The trouble with these industries is that, speaking generally, their management is scientifically weak, and to my mind they employ far too few graduates in research and development. In my view, what we need in a good many of our traditional industries, is a little less emphasis on the shop floor and a little more on the back room. I think that, unless there are very great changes in this respect, they do not have very much future.
How are we going to deal with these industries? Simple development contracts will not get us very far, because as they stand now a good number of the firms in these industries would not be capable of operating a development contract, owing to the fact that they have not the technical strength to do it. I would suggest that we make a very considerable push in the research association movement. I think the idea of the industrial research association is good. We have examples of research associations that have done extremely well, just as we have examples of some that have not done so well. But I think that if the idea were revitalised and pushed forward vigorously it could do something.
For example, the tendency to strive year by year to reduce the Government's contribution to these research associations is not a very good thing. It tends to put them too much at the mercy of the individual firms in the industry which may be rated, at any rate to a considerable extent, as backward. I should like to see these associations built up and given the job of really driving into industry. And when I say "really driving into industry", I am thinking, in particular, of the fact that it must be the object of any industrial research association to get research and development into the individual firms. You cannot get by on research at the centre; it must be done on the periphery. If research associations cannot persuade individual firms in their industries to do research and development themselves, then I believe they will have failed completely.
There is just one final point that I would make about technological development in industry. When I look at the pattern of British industry to-day, what do I see? I see a hard core of old-established, craft-based industries, most of them considerably developed about the time of the first Industrial Revolution early last century, and I see that core overlaid by a motley jumble of newer industries of every type. There is no evidence of conscious planning about the industrial pattern, although I think it is perfectly clear that in a country of our size and resources some conscious planning of our technological effort is necessary. We cannot possibly compete with other countries larger and wealthier than us in every conceivable sphere of activity. If we do, the only result will he that we shall spread our effort thinly all over the place and achieve nothing at all. Surely, we ought to concentrate on really developing those industries where there is a high content of technological skill. In such industries I believe that we can compete easily with the big battalions and we can ensure success. This problem of industrial priorities really is important, and it is high time that we were beginning to think about it; in fact, we need to do more than think about it—we must do something about it.
I was interested when I saw the statement made in another place last week about the Ministry of Technology. After giving a list of ways in which things ought to be done, it was stated, I think towards the end, that a study would be made of those industries suitable for action. I hope that the Ministry of Technology will have the courage to select some industries as suitable for inaction, because I do not believe it is any use, from the point of view of the country, propping up industries that have no real future. On the industrial side of the problem I will say no more. Other noble Lords who are here will speak with more authority on this subject of technology in industry, and with much more practical experience. But one thing is pretty sure: nothing at all is going to happen in industry unless we can provide ourselves with enough scientists and technologists, adequate both in numbers and in quality, to see the job through. This is a problem of education which concerns primarily the universities, but not only the universities; it concerns industry as well.
1103
How does our technological manpower situation look from the standpoint of the much-vaunted 4 per cent. annual increase in productivity? Not too good, I am afraid. The last Report of the Committee on Scientific Manpower, published in 1963, is, to say the least of it, disturbing. I think I am correct in saying that, if the proposals made in the Robbins Report are implemented, the number of university places available in technology is expected to double by around 1970. But even if we allow for the difficulty of making accurate estimates for future demand in manpower, it is still clear from the figures presented by the Committee on Scientific Manpower that there is going to be a very serious shortfall, and particularly in electrical and mechanical engineers.
The situation may even be worse than it looks now, because we should remember that last year there were about 400 unfilled places in technology in the universities and the colleges of advanced technology in this country; and, although final figures are not yet available, I believe it is true that there are unfilled places again this year. My Lords, it is not much good doubling our university places if we do not fill them. On top of this, there is the trouble that there is good evidence to show that the quality of university entrants in technology is, on average, rather lower than the quality of entrants into pure science. Apparently not enough of the brightest children want to study technology; and I am told that, at the same time, study of the arts in the universities is flourishing like the green bay tree.
Somehow or other technology seems to have a pretty poor public image, and something must be done about this if we are going to meet our manpower needs. It is in many ways odd that technology lacks attraction to the young because its study involves just as severe an intellectual discipline as that of pure science. In some ways its study is even more demanding, because, in a way, it is an art as well as a science, and its study involves objectives that bring into consideration economics and human relations—things which are of no moment in pure science at all. One would have thought it should be an exciting study, and that it should lead to a fascinating career, and yet it does not seem to be so in the eyes of the young. The reasons for this, of course, are many and complex. There is a kind ingrained social attitude in the country which thinks of industry as inferior to the professions as a career—and we all know that one of the most difficult and slowest things to change is social attitude.
However, I think that we do not help in the changing of this social attitude by the nomenclature which we employ. I think the application of the term "engineer" to cover everybody from a garage hand to a research technologist does not help matters very much; and I would also say that the use of the term "apprenticeship" to cover the period that a university graduate spends initially in industry certainly does not help to make engineering more attractive to a young man entering university studies. Some say that the trouble lies in the schools, where the children are not encouraged enough to go into technology. I suppose it is true that schoolmasters may often fail to point out as much as they should the technological implications of the science that they are teaching, but I do not believe that very much good would come of increasing the teaching of technology in schools. You cannot apply science until you have some science to apply, so I think the primary job in the schools will remain to teach science.
Quite apart from what the schoolmasters may do in this connection, I think the public media of communication in this country could do a lot more than they have done in the past—the radio, the Press, the television. At present far too often these organisms tend to concentrate on science. They "glamorise" scientific achievements, even going so far as to parade as triumphs of science things such as space ventures, which are essentially triumphs of technology. But the universities themselves are far from blameless in this matter. In too many of them engineering is still a little bit of a poor relation. I believe, too, that there are many young men who begin to find their interest turning to technology during their period at university, and that if it were made, in general, much more easy for a young man who has started in pure science to change over to technology during his course, without trouble and without loss of time, one would find a great many more men doing it. I know the possibility of so doing exists in some places, but in general it is not by any means so easy as it ought to be.
Something else which I think is perhaps equally important, if not more important, is this. Far too little attention has been paid to the development of really strong research schools in technological departments in the universities, and I believe that, until there are such strong research schools generally, technology will continue to lag behind science in its attractiveness. Because it must be remembered that part of the attraction to the young man of the study of a science like, say, my own subject, chemistry, is the glamour of the research which he visibly sees is going on in it and the ready appreciation of the way in which that research influences the development of chemical industry. One must realise that research activity has a glamour, and that is part of the reason for young men following up a subject.
Surely here is something in which the universities, industry and Government can really get together. I would hope that Government, for example, might farm out some really important research to universities, rather than try to pursue it in Government research stations. Government research stations are all very well, but I do not think one should underestimate the Let that if you put out to universities really worthwhile research in the technological field, not only will you attract more people into technology but you might even get the research done a bit better. I say that because I think that what you miss in a Government establishment and what you do not miss in a university is the priceless benefit of having a continued flow of young, fresh minds coming on to a subject—young, fresh minds full of ideas. Some of them are bad ideas, no doubt, but some of them are extremely good; and, on the whole, they will produce more good ideas than much older people will.
So I think Government ought to try to do this, and I think industry itself could help by doing something on these lines. Action of this type, as we know, has paid big dividends in America, and I do not see why it should not do so here. I do not think there is any need to fear that it would necessarily be car- ried to the point at which this contract work—because this is what it would be—would interfere with the basic freedom of universities to pursue research in any direction that they wished. Of course, to do this means that we have got to go a little further in getting the universities and industry together. It means some further lessening of the "ivory tower" attitude in the universities, and, equally, a lessening of the anti-academic attitude which prevails in too many circles in industry. This is a subject in which I know my noble friend Lord Bowden is interested, and I hope he will have something to say on it at a later stage.
Co-operation between our industries and the universities is, I think, needed nowhere more than in the devising of suitable courses of training for engineers and technologists in general. One could say a lot on this subject but I will just take up one basic point. For those who are going to be engaged in research, development or design, I think it is nonsense to suppose that a three-year course at a university from the age of eighteen can possibly give a broad enough grounding in essentials and an opportunity to pursue or even to select a specialised field for study in depth. I think it is equally incorrect to assume that a man, having done that three years, will pick up by his own efforts what he has missed or what he has not covered in those three years during his period of industrial employment. This just does not happen in general.
When one looks around, when one looks at the Continent of Europe, and sees that courses for engineers of five years' duration are common, one perhaps wonders whether we have much room for complacency; because many people, in addition to myself, are worried about the shortness of our engineering courses. This probably accounts for the rash of post-graduate courses that have appeared in the universities up and down the country in recent years. Yet I wonder whether all is well with these postgraduate courses. My impression of a lot of them is that they have a fairly high proportion of Commonwealth students in them and that industry does not seem to be rushing to send its best young men to take these post-graduate courses, Perhaps there is something wrong with the courses; perhaps industry and the universities ought to get together seriously to decide what kind of courses should be done.
But I do not think that is all. I should like to go a little further. I should like to suggest that some university should be bold and say that henceforth five years is going to be the minimum course for an honours degree in engineering. Possibly they might say this should consist of three years at the university, one year in industry and another year back in the university. I put this "sandwich" arrangement in because many of my friends and colleagues in the engineering world emphasise that it is absolutely vital after three years to get the men into industry. They may be right; although I confess I am not so sure. I wonder whether they could not get all they wanted out of doing some work during the university vacations in the earlier part of the course.
I know that chemistry is not the same as engineering, but I am always a little troubled by the fact that fifty years ago, or even more recently, when I was an undergraduate the chemical industry was totally uninterested in people taking post-graduate courses in chemistry. This was a hopeless affair: you did your three years and then went into industry. Industry was the place where you got your training. To-day chemists who are going into industry on the research development side normally have a training at the university which lasts at least six years. They do three years and then another period of post-graduate work. I wonder whether it is possible that the engineering industries are just a little behind in scientific development and that they might perhaps do well to think of proceeding in this direction a little more rapidly.
In view of the remarks I made before in your Lordships' House about technicians, I am not going to enlarge on that aspect of the manpower problem. To-day I hope only to stress again that this is a vital part in the whole question of technological development. Technicians we must have; and we must have them in far greater numbers than now. One of the things that always worried me about the Robbins Report was that, in its implementation, in the pursuit of university status by technical colleges and colleges of advanced technology they may perhaps seek—I am not sure there is not some evidence that some of them are seeking—to ape university courses and to move away from what I consider to be their real duty, the production of these technicians whom we need. I would only say again now that I hope I am wrong in thinking they may be losing sight of their objective; but I am sure I am right in saying that if they do lose sight of their objective they will do this country a very great disservice indeed.
Already, I have taken up quite a lot of your Lordships' time. I should like to make only one further point before I sit down. I think it will be clear to your Lordships, even from what I have said this afternoon, that in my view science and technology are all part of one thing; they are interwoven to such an extent that we cannot make any clear division between them. In the field of research and development in this country we are, I think, at the present moment spending each year about 3 per cent. of our gross national product and our expenditure has been doubling about once every five years since the end of the war. Nor is there any sign that the demands are lessening and that, if they are all met, this rate of increase is going to drop. Yet, of course, it is obvious that it cannot go on for ever. It is perfectly clear that if you keep doubling every five years you will by about the year 2000 be in the ludicrous situation of spending the entire national income each year in research and development.
In other words, we are going to have to make some pretty hard choices in the near future. We are going to have to determine our priorities and to concentrate our main effort on those areas where we are going to get, from the national point of view, the most value for our money. This means that we must have a scientific policy for this country. We must have one scientific policy, not two or three or more scientific policies. I do not believe that we can set up a policy in technology, on the one hand, and in science, on the other. This just does not work. The two are intimately connected, not only in operation but even when we come to consider such a thing as the development of a national manpower policy. Of course, it was for this reason that, as a member of the Trend Committee, I was in favour of the proposal in our report that science and technology should come under the ægis of one Minister. I am not much worried about nomenclature, about whether you call something technology or industrial research and development or what you call it.
There are many different ways in which we can handle this matter. But I am, I confess, just a little worried, and I should like to have a little reassurance on the situation where we now have one Minister responsible for technology, one Minister responsible for science and, somewhere swinging on the outside, a Minister of Aviation, who himself seems to be dealing with a lot of science and technology. I believe that we must have one scientific policy and that we must operate it with vigour.
I hope that the noble Lords, Lord Bowden and Lord Snow, will be able to reassure me on this one point: that there is going to be real co-ordination and real co-operation between these Ministries and with the Department for Economic Affairs in developing a single policy. I say this because in such experience as I have had in Whitehall I have come to distrust coordination which is set up by having a lot of committees on which sit representatives of this body and that body. Too often, it seems to me, representation is carried out by office boys who do not know what is going on. I should like to be assured that we really are going to have co-ordination there. Otherwise, I think the results could be disastrous. One policy, and one policy only, will do, if we are going to study the questions I have mentioned of industrial priorities. To my mind, these questions lie at the heart of our future. I beg to move for Papers.

VISCOUNT CALDECOTE My Lords, I know that the whole House will be grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Todd, for initiating this important debate to-day. The noble Lord has put me in a difficult position, in having to follow one so distinguished and experienced in this subject, particularly as this is the first occasion on which I have stood at this Table.
The last few weeks have shown us once again how delicate is the balance of our economy. The whole emphasis over the past few weeks has been on financial problems, but I think it is wise that we should remember the hard and simple fact behind these problems: we do not make enough things and provide suffi- cient services of the required quality and value for money to attract adequate overseas orders. This is a point which has already been well made by the noble Lord, Lord Todd. No doubt, as he said, improved management training, wider education and harder work can improve the situation, but all of them will be of little avail if our scientific knowledge is not made to work efficiently for industry.
I believe that to-day there is little disagreement about the pressing need to harness scientific knowledge and make industry more efficient and produce more competitively. So much has rightly been said about the importance of research and development, particularly of research, that I think perhaps there is some danger of too much attention being given to planting and cultivating the trees of research and some danger that we shall lose sight of the wood of industry, whose health and prosperity is of such prime importance. So, whether we are considering industry entirely on its own or considering Government action in this field, it is of prime importance that we should look at the need for industry to make more and better things to sell.
Surely the use of scientific knowledge in this way is the heart and kernel of technology. It is not by the number of establishments, by the amount of money and by the number of people who are involved, that we should judge the success, but by the results. And this applies just as much to Government as it does to industry. Indeed, when we are embarking on new organisations and on new Ministries, I think it is wise to look carefully at this question. It is equally important that the Ministry of Technology and its establishments should have high productivity or, to use modern jargon, that its cost effectiveness should be high, as it is in a factory in industry.
It is often suggested that there is some fundamental difference between Government and industry in their approach to this problem, but I do not believe that this is true at all in the field of technology. Maybe there is some difference in the balance of importance between long and short term, but in neither Government nor industry is there room for misdirected effort, for resources devoted to work irrelevant to forecasted requirements, or for emotion. Nor is this field one in which scientists should be primarily interested in the extension of knowledge rather than in its application. So, in debating this Motion to-day, and, indeed, in any discussion on the relation of technology to industry, we need to keep clearly in front of us the objective of applying scientific knowledge effectively to promote the prosperity of industry. It is against this background that we should judge the new organisations that are being set up and the Government's policy. We certainly do not want to prejudge this issue. We want to assess it on its merits.
There is no inherent merit in setting up a new Ministry. In industry, when problems of organisation arise, it is often suggested that the best way to solve them is to set up a new company. The first question that should always be asked on these occasions is: what is the new company going to do that cannot be done in some other way? Then it should be asked: how is it going to operate? What will its functions be? And what will be its lines of communication and command? There is no doubt at all of the need for action in this field, but it must be considered action. I think that this is important because, apart from meeting the Government's own requirements, the close association in technology between Government and industry on an appreciable scale is a fairly new development in our type of competitive economy. So this debate to-day, at the formative stage of the new Government's policies, is particularly welcome.
Some people advocate an arms-length approach by the Government to science and technology. They advocate the setting up of largely autonomous organisations under the ægis, it has been said, rather than under the control, of a Minister. Clearly there are many advantages of such an arrangement. There is freedom from short-term political disturbances and interference. There is freedom for the staff to pursue the scientific work which they feel is necessary to meet to-morrow's needs. And there is the ability to cover wide fields of technology of interest to many industries and Government Departments. Such an organisation, I would entirely agree, is admirable for supervising research in academic institutions, for the important job of training scientists in research, for adding to the store of scientific knowledge and for all aspects of long-term research.
But if the emphasis shifts to the application of knowledge, to technology and its relevance to producing new and improved products, I think that there is much less certainty that this is the best way of proceeding. Even the staunchest allies of this system, where the emphasis is on freedom, would admit that it has not all the advantages. For in technology and its application to industry there is the important factor of discipline. Discipline, dictated by the relevance of cost and time scales, becomes of increasing importance.
The real difference between one type of scientific research and the other is not in the complicated arguments between basic, fundamental or academic research and applied research or technology, or whatever we like to call it. It is really between the objectives and the environment in which the work is carried on. Surely this is the real basis of the case for the separation of responsibilities between education and science, on the one hand, and technology and industry, on the other, as is now intended. It is very true, as the noble Lord. Lord Todd, has emphasised, that there is a need for a policy for science and technology. But there is also a need for a policy for technology and industry. And the needs of these two have to be balanced against each other. I should like to examine constructively the proposals that are before us with these objectives and needs in mind.
The statements in another place last week indicate, I think, the very reasonable division, if division there is to be, between the responsibilities of the Secretary of State for Education and Science and the Minister of Technology. As I understand it, the Minister of Technology is to take direct control of many of the industrial establishment of the D.S.I.R., and of N.R.D.C. But it is not at all clear, I think, how it is intended to achieve the right balance between the direction of policy and the scientific freedom that is so essential in many of these establishments.
The recent statement by the Minister of Technology also indicates the close connections with industry which he intends to have. He has set up a very fine Advisory Council, containing eminent industrialists. This, I think, should go a long way to bringing the right policies to bear on the problem. It has also been stated that the Minister of Technology is going to be the sponsor of several important industries. How these industries have been chosen is not at all clear. Why is it that electronics, machine tools and computers have been chosen, and not, for instance, the shipbuilding industry, to which the noble Lord, Lord Todd, has already referred? I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Snow, will be able to tell us something behind the decisions that have been taken.
As regards sponsorship, it is important to be clear what sponsorship means. In my view, it means representing the interests of an industry in the highest policy-making bodies of Government; it means encouraging sound policies in research and development, and co-ordinating industrial and Government action, particularly in exports. It does not, I hope, mean interference with management and direction on the basis of "the man in Whitehall knows best".
THE PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY, MINISTRY OF TECHNOLOGY (LORD SNOW) Of course not.
VISCOUNT CALDECOTE The noble Lord says, "Of course not". I hope that this is true. But the Prime Minister in another place, in a Written Answer, recently gave this reply [OFFICIAL REPORT, Commons, Vol. 702 (No. 21) col. 216]: The Minister of Technology has the general responsibility of guiding and stimulating a major national effort to bring advanced technology and new processes into British industry. The methods employed will include an intensified use of the appropriate Research Stations and of the National Research Development Corporation, civil development contracts and studies to identify particular industries or parts of industries suitable for action. What does "suitable for action" mean? Who will decide what company or industry is "suitable"? What kind of action is envisaged? The noble Lord, Lord Todd, mentioned the important matter of priorities. How are these priorities to be determined in the new set-up with the Ministry of Technolgy? It having been determined, in some way which we have not yet been told, which industries are suitable for action, what action will be taken; and how will the action be taken? Will it be taken by agreement and consultation, or will it be done by direction? If it is to be done by direction, will it be done after public discussion? Will plans be laid before Parliament, so that we may know the kind of action envisaged and the policies from which it will spring?
From a more recent answer of the Prime Minister, to which the noble Lord, Lord Todd, has already referred, it appears that the Government intend to set up Government-owned competition in certain cases. It is often assumed that if some industry or company is failing it can be put right by having more competition. This, in many instances, is quite wrong. In every industry there is, I believe, an optimum level of competition. If already you are past that optimum level of competition, it may well do active harm and damage to institute further competition. It may make too much competition for the supply of skilled labour and the supply of engineers; and it may waste scarce capital resources. So I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Snow, or the noble Lord, Lord Bowden, will be able to assure us that full consultation and consideration will be given to the sort of plans they have in mind, and that this consideration will precede action and not come after it. For so much damage can be done by ill-considered plans in this field.
On the other hand, I am sure everyone in your Lordships' House will agree that there are great opportunities, and that the new Ministry of Technology can do a great deal in the sphere of Government to promote industrial prosperity. It can, for instance, ensure that full weight is given to the needs of an industry by the Government as purchasers. In the computer industry, for example, there are great problems in this country in competing with the American giants in this field. One of the reasons for this is that the great American companies have vast experience, not only in technical design and manufacture of computers, but also in what is called in the trade the software or the peripheral equipment that goes with it. This experience has come, to a large extent, from the huge orders placed by the American Government for computers. If, in this country, when the Government wish to buy a computer for their own purposes, they go abroad because companies abroad have greater experience of manufacture or operating them, we shall never add to the experience of companies in this country, and we shall simply be going down a most unsatisfactory kind of spiral.
Then there is another field of Government policy which is very relevant to this problem, and it is taxation. Much more could be done in this field. I believe it to be the case that the prosperity of the diesel engine industry in this country is largely due to the fact that diesel oil has had a lower tax rate, on the whole, than petrol. This has involved great emphasis being put on the development of efficient diesel engines.
In another field, we hear a lot nowadays about numerically or tape-controlled machine tools. These are in great evidence in the United States. There are far more of them in use in the United States industry than in this country. One of the reasons is that in Government contracts in the United States the cost of purchase of such machines is allowed in the cost of the contract. In this country the machines have to be provided out of private capital. Again, would it not be possible to treat the capital cost of buying such equipment in the same way as we treat research equipment for tax purposes, to enable it to be written off more quickly? These are all aspects which I hope the new Ministry of Technology will study and where they can make a substantial contribution. I hope, also, that they will investigate research and development activities in, for instance, some of the nationalised industries. Perhaps some of their policies are too narrow. They may look only to their own needs and not to the effect of specification which they issue on the needs of the export market.
I greatly welcome the part that I understand the new Ministry is to play in extracting more useful information for industry from defence technology. But this raises the whole question of relations with other Government Departments, such as, for instance, the Ministry of Aviation. What is the relationship going to be between the new Ministry of Technology and the Royal Radar Establishment at Malden, and the Signals Research and Development Establishment at Christchurch? What will its relation be with the Dollis Hill Laboratories of the General Post Office, with the Ministry of Power and with other Service research establishments? There is, for instance, an extremely peculiar situation which seems to have arisen on the Atomic Energy Authority, for it appears that the whole Atomic Energy Authority is coming under the control of the new Ministry of Technology, including, as I understand it, the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Aldermaston. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Snow, will be able to tell us how this is to be organised.
It seems to me that the position of the new Ministry of Technology is very closely analogous to the position of a central co-ordinating authority for research and development in a big commercial organisation. It will have tremendous problems of communication to ensure that available knowledge is utilised to the full, and to prevent duplication both of current and capital expenditure.
Now these are all clear objectives. But to achieve them, as the noble Lord, Lord Todd, has mentioned, there are going to be great problems of communications and links between the new Ministry and the other Government Departments operating in similar fields. I hope that the noble Lords who are to reply for the Government will be able to indicate to us some of the ways in which these vitally important horizontal links are in fact to be forged, because without them the whole edifice is going to look very stupid in a few months' time. Not least is the important relationship that must exist between the Secretary of State for Education and Science and the new Minister of Technology, so as to provide a coherent policy on science and technology, right across the board, including dealing with the problems of manpower.
In conclusion, may I return to my original point? I hope that we shall concentrate in our discussions, and that noble Lords opposite will concentrate in their plans, on the objective of improving the prosperity of industry and making its products more competitive. I think noble Lords on this side of the House all recognise the sincerity of the Government in this objective. I believe there will be many problems in this new set-up, and I have touched upon one or two. We on this side of the House will judge the new proposals and the action which the Government will take against the background that I have sketched and against this vitally important objective. We may disagree frequently on the ways and means, but the Government can rely on constructive, even if vigorous, criticism. We all believe in the importance of more competitive industry, and we believe in the importance of the contribution that technology can make to it, and the need for wise and effective Government action. So, my Lords, in this vitally important field we will, as I say, look, very carefully, but, I hope. constructively, on everything the Government put before us.

THE PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY, MINISTRY OF TECHNOLOGY (LORD SNOW) My Lords, I should like to begin by thanking the noble Lord, Lord Todd, for introducing this debate, and for making a speech which was nothing if not constructive and friendly. In fact, I may say, with sincerity, that I agree with about 90 per cent. of it, and he could just as well have made it from this place. May I suggest to your Lordships that it is very remarkable that a Master of a Cambridge College should be in that measure of agreement with a former Fellow? Similarly, I deeply welcome the speech of the noble Viscount, Lord Caldecote, which I also thought was extremely friendly across the Floor of this House. I think most of his questions were well placed, and I will do my best to answer most of those which do not impede our freedom of action in the next few months.
May I begin by repeating my kind of Carthage speech? This country has to earn a living. The whole point of our activities is to help it to earn a living. We will do that by every conceivable means which come to our hands; every conceivable idea which floats through our heads. There is no one bright idea which is going to solve this problem—your Lordships can put that right out of your minds. There is no one single nos- trum which is going to solve this country's problems. There are many different things which have to be tackled. We have to tackle those things which come nearest to our attention. But that is not the total answer, even if we are more successful than I think we are likely to be. Therefore, there is no one solution we have to find many. It is for all of us to be part of this enterprise. It is going to be quite difficult; do not let us deceive ourselves about that. But some things can be done. It was because some rather obvious things could be done that the Ministry of Technology was set up.
I will deal here, as I think noble Lords would wish me to, first with that part of the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Todd, in which he disagreed with our general policy. All the rest that he said is in fact exactly the stuff of our thinking, and every suggestion he made, I think I can say without exception, is either in the course of what they call in the Civil Service "active study" or, alternatively, already in the course of action. However, the noble Lord disagreed with the separation of the Ministry of Technology from the Ministry of Education and Science. I should like to begin by correcting the kind of misapprehension which I think is not uncommon among noble Lords opposite, and possibly in the country at large—the idea that this was a sudden, bright thought which occurred on October 15 and was done capriciously, without deliberation, and without the taking of such advice as was open to intelligent persons not in the Government. That is the absolute opposite of the truth. In fact, to my certain knowledge, persons not in Government, not in official positions, have been thinking seriously about the whole of this problem of the machinery of government, particularly in its relation to science and technology, for at least the last ten years.
When it became clear that things were going very badly for us technologically in the early 'fifties, a great many persons became preoccupied, sometimes obsessed, with what sensible steps, organisational, scientific and technological, could be taken to help us to put the matter right. There have been many different kinds of model structures of government—I have written several of them myself, so I know. I have certainly changed my mind once or twice on what is the best model of government. It is quite clear that there is no perfect one. Brute reality is too complex to catch in any administrative framework in which we may try to fit it. That is obvious. Any attempt to act upon the directive which we are given, which is to stimulate technology in industry—and this has been obvious enough as an intention for ten years—is bound to impinge to some extent on, not one other Ministry, but at least five or six others. We are clearly concerned on one fringe with the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and we are clearly concerned with the Department of Education and Science, the Ministry of Labour, and the Board of Trade. One imbecile solution would be to have a great omnibus Ministry, including anything where science and technology could conceivably even have a faint part. That is clearly ridiculous.
What else is there? Then you think of what is really the only pair of alternatives. One is to have a sort of global Ministry of Education and Science, with technology added in according to the I.R.D.A. Plan, and the other is the split which, after very long discussion with all kinds of persons, was in fact decided upon. Your Lordships will note that Sir Leon Bagrit, who thinks with us on most of these matters and is in fact intimately in our counsels, produced exactly the same solution in his Reich Lectures. I am not giving away a secret when I state that those Lectures were recorded long before recent Governmental changes. His Ministry of Modernisation was precisely the Ministry which has now been set up.
I agree that the split is quite seriously arguable. In fact, it has been argued here this afternoon. The reasons which finally brought us to thinking that this was the necessary solution were these: first, on the negative side. I am inclined to think that noble Lords who have not actually existed in Government Departments are disposed to believe that all is done if you have one boss; that the whole answer is thereby reached. I assure noble Lords that nothing could be further from the truth. Early in the last war I happened to be a very junior civil servant in a very large Ministry. For a time I was lucky, because I could perform my curious activities under the shelter of my dear old friend Lord Hankey. Then Lord Hankey's influence lapsed and I found myself in the kind of departmental (that is, within one Department) in-fighting, knifing, faction-formation and gang warfare which made me feel: "Good Lord, I might as well be back in Cambridge!" These borderlines between any kind of administrative set-ups are extraordinarily difficult to draw. When you draw them, the rough answer is that with goodwill and common purpose on both sides, whatever the form, then the thing will work. If there is not that goodwill and that common purpose, then, with the best and neatest lines of command in the world, the thing does not go. This I am quite certain is true. Therefore, one super Ministry would have, in fact, almost all the difficulties which noble Lords have raised.
My Lords, the second point was positive, that it seemed to us to be relatively easy, with reasonable sense, to construct links across these Ministries which would, in fact, solve most, though I think not all, of the difficulties raised by the noble Lord, Lord Todd. One, of course, is the device, which the noble Lord dismissed, I think, a little unfairly, of the memberships of common councils, which, if these councils are highly enough placed, can be of great value. But far more important than that is the relationship between Ministers themselves and officials at every level. If at all the operative levels there is agreement, then, in fact, policy can really be decided. Fortunately that agreement exists, and was already known to exist when Ministers were appointed.
Further, a good deal can be done by what in the theatre they call "cross-casting". It may not have escaped your Lordships' notice that the most distinguished scientific mind in the Ministry of Technology is, in fact, a pure scientist and one of world distinction, Professor Blackett. It is true that Professor Blackett has a gift—a gift which made him invaluable in the war, and which this country has not recognised sufficiently—of being able to think of practical problems with a kind of depth of insight known to very few. This saved us many lives and many ships in the last war. That kind of gift he is now applying to what are not dissimilar problems in industry. He is, nevertheless, a mire scientist and it is as such that he is known to the world. On the other hand, by the same process of cross-casting, my noble friend Lord Bowden, who is, of course, the most dis- tinguished technological educator in the country, is sitting in the Ministry of Science, and it was this ingenious crossing which seemed to gentlemen in power to reduce, and to a large extent eliminate, the dangers of the separation of these two ministries.
But, of course, there was an overwhelming reason why the new Ministry should be set up; aid it is simply this. We believe, and I am sure noble Lords opposite believe, that it is passionately necessary to give a new dynamic to industry, a new dynamic to technological innovation in industry. This you will never do, in our judgment, if in fact you just import technology as an important, but still a junior, part to a large omnibus Ministry. If you just put it into a Department of Education and Science then, in fact, you are removing all the imaginative appeal; you are taking away all the power of stimulating the young technologist, which is very important and from which we have had satisfactory results already. And, finally, to take any action at all in matters so vital you must be able to have a Minister with the authority of a major Cabinet Minister doing this and doing nothing else. This seemed to most people concerned, except to certain noble Lords opposite, to the only good, though not a perfect, solution to a tough problem. That is my one point of difference from the noble Lord, Lord Todd. I should now like to say a word or two about what this Ministry is immediately proposing to do and to answer, sometimes by inference, the noble Viscount. Lord Caldecote.
My Lords, the statement of my right honourable friend the Prime Minister has, I think, given noble Lords a pretty fair account of what we are going to do. Rather to my surprise the noble Viscount asked why four particular industries had been singled out for immediate study and attention. I should have thought that that was answered completely by the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Todd. For, in fact, these are industries of the most advanced kind, vital in any modern society. If you do not have them in full health, it means that you cannot pretend to be independent in any meaningful sense. That is, no country which does not have a flourishing automation industry, a flourishing electronic industry, a flourishing computer industry and a flourishing machine tool industry can really pretend that it can determine its own future.
I think there is absolutely no question of this technologically. These are going to be what are called, in a rther absurd phrase, some of the greatest points of growth. It is for that simple reason that they were selected, rather than the older, far more backward industries, and we are now studying them with considerable concentration. In fact, we began to study some of them the day after my right honourable friend Mr. Cousins entered office.
My Lords, the means we intend to use should, I think, be obvious enough, certainly to the noble Viscount who has seen very much the same procedure carried out in the defence industries. There are several steps. One is the use of the development contract. This has been done in the defence industry for 20-odd years. The possibility that this is going occasionally to look arbitrary cannot be removed: it has not been removed ever in the defence industry. Where possible, the whole of industry, or large parts of industry, will be there to give us advice We have deliberately set up an exceptionally highly-placed and highly-gifted Advisory Council on Technology to give us advice on just this type of problem. But noble Lords can realise that with any kind of development contract of this kind, ultimately someone has to decide it; and that is what Ministers are for.
The second technique which we propose to use is an intelligent adaptation of Mr. McNamara's purchasing. This Mr. McNamara has done with astonishing ingenuity for a number of years, and the effects on American industry, in fields I know a little about, have been dramatic. We think we may learn a tip or two from the Americans in various kinds of education, but I am not at all sure that we cannot learn even more from them in this type of very hard business. So this use of purchasing power will certainly be one of our major weapons.
The third method we are going to use is rather surprising and very prosaic. It is listening. We propose to listen to everyone who has an idea and who cares to talk to us during whatever period we may be in these positions. We spent the whole of yesterday listening, and the result of that listening, I think, will be a certain number of thousands of pounds to this country. Remember, wisdom does not reside completely, or indeed very largely, in persons in temporary high places. Wisdom goes deep, and it does not belong always to the old. This country is rather bad at technology but it is not at all bad at producing technologists. There is a great deal of restive, impatient talent through the whole of industry, everywhere you like to go. These people have much to tell us. It is for us to listen to them. Certain choices clearly you have to make. But if technology is going to be more than a word we pass about in a debating society, it is by this process of consultation that we are going to get some of our best results.
I should now like to turn to what, in fact, was Lord Todd's third point; that is, the condition of the traditional industries. This, I think, is going to be much tougher; I am sure it is going to be much tougher. With good fortune we may shortly have something to say on the advanced industries. We shall not speak too soon or too much. This does not seem to me to be wise. But I am fairly confident that my right honourable friend Mr. Cousins will be able to say something about the taking of necessary first steps in some more suitable place than this just after Christmas. Then I shall probably nave an opportunity a little later of reporting to your Lordships' House. These steps one can see. One cannot see anything like so easily what we can usefully do with traditional industries.
Some things, again, are obvious; for example, the use of the research associations. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Todd, that there one can produce a real impact if we believe in them and give them a certain amount of encouragement. That they have been very much lacking. But the plight of the traditional industries seems to be linked with a much deeper malaise in this country. That deeper malaise is that we still do not really believe in the technological revolution. A few of us do, but not many. I believe that right through our society it is still regarded as an un- fortunate event which, if we turn our backs, may not really happen. It may not be happening around us. We may still, somehow, in some fantastic fashion, or by English luck, earn a living sonic other way. This is nonsense. But I am fairly sure that this kind of feeling unconsciously afflicts a good deal of our society.
It certainly produces one effect which is serious and at the root of some of our defects and some of our difficulties elsewhere. That is the extremely low status accorded to engineers. Of all countries I know, this country respects engineers the least. If you go to America or Russia or the Continent of Europe a man is very proud to be an engineer, and usually has it on his card. That would not happen here. The same feeling of being an active, useful and valued member of society happens here to a far less extent, and I have no doubt that this is one of the reasons why young men are not attracted to the profession in anything like the numbers we require. It is maddening that in fact at this moment every arts place in every university in this island has been filled—and the figures may be worse than the noble Lord, Lord Todd, quoted—yet hundreds of pure science places and more than that of technological places are left unfilled. This is maddening. If it goes on long enough then all our efforts any bit of ingenuity we may have had, all our complete dedication, are going to get us nowhere.
Society here has got to be worked on. As to how we can work on it I have only a few random ideas. But certainly we have to change the climate of society at least enough to make it give respect and fully embrace those who make the wealth. If we do not do that, then I cannot see how this decline can be stopped. The kind of thing which may be valuable is, I believe, what happened last week. I suspect that the most practical step in the direction in which the noble Lord, Lord Todd, wanted to urge us, and in which I am now trying to urge us, was taken not by the Government but by the Council of the Royal Society. I believe that the Royal Society's saying, "We will give a number of places to technologists each year" will have more effect in getting really good people into technology than anything the Government or industry can do over the next ten years. We must have more devices of this kind.
The climate is stale. We do not realise how stale our climate in relation to technology now is. If we can get only a little wind through it my right honourable friend and I will feel that we have not completely wasted our time.

VISCOUNT MILLS My Lords, I have listened with the greatest pleasure and interest to the eloquent speech by the noble Lord, Lord Snow. I hope that what he has had to tell your Lordships this afternoon will be justified by events. We have been most fortunate in hearing the noble Lord, Lord Todd, who is of such distinction and of such knowledge, in regard to both technology and the universities, that he is able to give us a very authoritative view on the state of technological development. I am venturing to take part in this debate because I believe that we are in for great changes—great changes in our lives, in our industries, in our country and in the world. I do not go all the way with the noble Lord, Lord Snow, in his view of the traditional industries. I believe that they, too, are conscious of the changes which E re before us.
It has been said that the Roman Empire existed by virtue of the grandest application of technology that the world had seen: its roads, its bridges, its great buildings, its sewers and tunnels, its metallurgy and agriculture. The scientific background was of course supplied by Greece. With the disappearance of the Roman Empire and Greece came the Dark Ages. It was then that we had the gradual lift to better conditions in which scientific discoveries and the related technologies could make their impact on our lives.
I believe that the relative importance of technology and pure science really depends on the social environment during a particular period. I believe we have arrived at a period when industry has to be transformed, and is being transformed, by the application of the great scientific discoveries and technologies which are increasingly at our service. The noble Lord, Lord Todd, gave us a definition of technology, which I might simply state as the scientific study of the practical or industrial arts. This definition is a good one in emphasising the scientific nature of technology, but I think it fails to give a proper realisation, a proper idea, of the dynamic relationship between technology and the pure sciences.
Science and technology are really inter-related. It is easy to illustrate the view that technology is the handmaiden of pure science. The study of astronomy awaited the development of technology for the production of telescopes and, in later years, of radio equipments. Advances in biology and medicine have been conditioned by the technology of microscopes and X-rays. One could go on citing such examples. Conversely, however, the development of technology depends on advances in pure science. The application of X-rays followed the original discovery of Röntgen; the manifold uses of electric power depend on the discoveries of Faraday; the use of radio for communications is based on the work of Maxwell and Hertz. So technology and science are inter-related. The scientist must know something of technology: the technologist must work from a scientific basis.
The late th and the early th centuries haw a great expansion in the field of pure science. The technology required to make all these discoveries possible was of a limited nature and perhaps relatively unimportant. In the last two or three decades, however, technology has become of greatly increased importance, partly on account of pressure to apply discoveries of the preceding period to practical use, and partly because the experiments required to extend our knowledge of science demand a far greater technological background to carry them out. In many fields of scientific research—for example, the study of the atomic nucleus or the study of controlled thermonuclear reactions—great technological resources are required; so much so that this particular type of research can no longer be conducted, as has traditionally been the case, in the universities, but requires permanently staffed organisations of national and even international size in order to make appreciable progress.
We should therefore envisage the situation in the future whereby a significant and increasing amount of pure research in the physical sciences must be undertaken in permanently staffed laboratories such as those of Government or industry. It can no longer be assumed that researches and progress in pure science can be left to the universities if they have as their primary objective the training of students. It is clear that in the future scientific and technological progress can be considerably assisted by much closer contacts between industry and the universities.
I listened with great attention to what the noble Lord, Lord Todd, had to say about post-graduate studies. I think that an efficient procedure would be to regard technology as a post-graduate study to he conducted in the universities, and for this the new universities evolving from the colleges of advanced technology appear to be especially suitable. If the basic principles of technology of any particular subject were taught as a postgraduate course, this could be extended to research in technological subjects, which could be of great advantage to our industries. The methods and procedures of technological research are identical with those employed in research in pure science. The only difference is the objective—in the second case, to discover new knowledge; in the first case, how and where to apply it.
Technology, however, has another aspect, remote from pure science—namely, the economic aspect. The advances in technology are triggered by a need to satisfy some tangible requirement—instruments for scientific research, a new medium for public entertainment, or a new device for domestic use. These requirements usually have a more immediate economic background than the investigations of pure science. If a sufficiently wide application is foreseen, money and effort are devoted to technological research and development. The technologist, therefore, needs to have some knowledge of industrial economics to appreciate the financial aspects of his work. I should like to emphasise that we in industry require technologists of the same mental calibre as those who now pursue pure science in our universities.
I have been most impressed throughout my business life with the success that we in this country have had in scientific subjects and scientific discoveries. On the other hand, I have been concerned with the technological advances which have been so evident in the United States, and which have kept that country competitive while enjoying high standards of living and leisure. During the next few years I believe that we shall be entering upon an epoch when the day-to-day control of industrial processes, now in the hands of human operators, will be largely the province of electronic machines. The whole of our industry, if it is to be competitive, will need to use such machines. This means, in effect, that applied technology will become basic to the whole of our industrial structure. There are already signs that machines will be constructed which will have the ultimate possibility of carrying out industrial control operations, which now require human supervision, and that in due course this will cause a revolutionary change in the whole pattern of industry.
We in industry know that a considerable effort, mainly financed by Government sources, is employed in the United States of America in this field, whereas the effort of the United Kingdom is small and rather scattered. The whole subject is far too large for any single company, or even for any single research establishment, to handle. It requires massive support from the Government and it is of vital importance, as the noble Lord, Lord Snow, realises, to work out a plan whereby Government and industry can cooperate in this effort, so that the resources of scientific manpower can be most effectively employed. In this country we must export to live and to maintain and improve our standards. We are ahead, I believe, in scientific progress. Our technological advances are essential to keep us competitive in a changing world. I would end by saying that we should not be content to be the Greece to an American Rome.

THE EARL OF HALSBURY My Lords, in rising to speak to the Motion of my noble friend Lord Todd, I would say that there is one proposition which I believe we all accept. I think it was well put by the noble Lord, Lord Snow, when he referred to the impossibility of a sort of onmium gatherum of interests, ranging from primary education on the one hand to research contracts for industry on the other, all the responsibility of one large, inchoate and heterogeneous Ministry. I believe that is a proposition which we all accept; I certainly accept it. So, somewhere, it must be split. The reason why men of goodwill find it difficult to agree on where the split should be made is simply that there is no natural point indicated for this split. It is, to a very large extent, a matter of opinion and of how one feels. I should myself have preferred to keep science and technology together and accept the split at the point where school passes over into university education. This was the Robbins solution, and it was the one which I preferred. But, for some reason or another, which I never quite understood, a year ago there was a sort of bipartisan stampede away from the conclusions of the Robbins Report, and it is no longer a live issue. Our problem, therefore, is to live with some alternative and get the best out of it by helping it to work.
Dealing with the alternatives, I would say that I never liked the last Government's friendship to wards I.R.D.A., as recommended in the Trend Report. As said in this House before, I thought that the work contemplated for I.R.D.A. was so wide that it should have been a direct Ministerial and not an indirect Ministerial responsibility. The solution of the present Government has resolved my objection to I.R.D.A. by accepting the direct Ministerial responsibility which I advocated for technology, but, of course, a price has had to be paid for it. The advantage of the I.R.D.A. scheme was that I.R.D.A. was ultimately to have been responsible to the Minister of Science, so that it grouped science and technology together. The solution of the present Government has the opposite effect. Technology is given an independent status, which I am sure we all very much welcome, but the homogeneity of science and technology has been split down the middle in consequence. That is the price we have to pay.
I shall not deal with generalities, for I find myself in a very substantial measure of agreement with my noble friend Lord Todd, and I have little to add to what he has said and the warnings he has given. I should like to add point to some of his warnings by quoting from my own experience. First of all, I hope that no attempt will be made to try to draw boundaries between the two Ministries of so precise a nature that their work grinds to a standstill while terms of reference are being debated so as to assign some project or other to one or another of two contestants. I do not want the Civil Service backcloth of the Parliamentary stage to be bulging and thudding with demarcation disputes so as to take the audience's attention off the drama.
The reason I am insistent on this point is that I have some experience in this field. When the Development of Inventions Act was passed, I had the honour to be entrusted with the formative years of the National Research Development Corporation. During my first five years my terms of reference were a very heavy burden to hear, because they tried to discriminate between development, the proper province of the Corporation, and research, which was not its business. This discrimination was impossible. Over and over again the first stage of development discloses research problems which have to be tackled before development can proceed any further. Failing a resolute assault on these, development is blocked. Time and again I found myself trying to concert action with one or another of the Research Councils.
This is the sort of thing that happened. I said to one or another of the Councils, "I propose to support Professor X". "Oh, but that is research", I would be told, "that is our business, not yours". "But it is an important stage in development", I would reply. "Very well, then", the answer came, "as a compromise we will do it if you pay for it". At this point I had to say, "No, I'm sorry, that is not an acceptable corn, promise. Nobody is going to do anything except Professor X. The only thing to do, apart from Professor X's activities, is to pay. If it is ultra vires for me to pay Professor X, it is just as much ultra vires to pay a Research Council". Our terms of reference were concerned not with whom we might pay, but what we might do. After five years of this sort of thing—which did not make the work of the Corporation impossible; but did make the work which we were doing more difficult—we got an amending Act liberalising our terms of reference a little, and thereafter the administration became a lot easier.
If I may borrow a term from engineering technology, I hope that no attempt will be made to specify some sort of push-fit between the terms of references of the two Ministries, so that research is assigned to one and development and technology to the other in an unambiguous sort of way. As the noble Lord, Lord Bowden, is well aware, the trouble with push-fits is that the slightest misalignment causes a seize-up; the terms of reference must provide for a generous overlap to be adjusted at working level as circumstances require. If some pure scientist finds that his work has a technological bearing he must be free to follow it up, because his alone will be the insight and enthusiasm which will follow it up adequately. This means that the funds available for his support must be free for allocation, irrespective of narrowly-drawn terms of reference. Similarly, if a technologist finds himself blocked by some basic gap in knowledge he must he free to adopt the methods of pure science and go and find it. This again means that the funds available for supporting him must be free for allocation and not bound by narrowly-drawn rules governing their use. If these principles were followed, then the new set-up could he workable, though still at a Trice.
I should like to go on with one or two explicit illustrations, and I will take one from computer technology. I have no interest to declare in the computer industry. I am not a director of, or employee in, or consultant to, any firm engaged in the industry. But sixteen years ago I did, as a public servant, under the chairmanship of my noble friend Lord Mills, whom I am glad to see in his place this afternoon, help him and our colleagues to allocate the funds which made it possible for computer developments to start in this country, and so gave the industry a beginning. For this reason I have, without any interest in it, had a ringside seat at the councils of the industry ever since.
Possibly for this reason I am now Chairman of the D.S.I.R. Committee on Computing Science, and correspondingly concerned with applications for grants for research of special timeliness and promise into what is sometimes called "software". I shall not, of course, discuss these applications in particular terms, as this would be quite out of order. But I think it permissible to say that they are an inextricable mixture of the purely practical and purely theoretical, some of them scientific, some of them technological, though they all come from universities, and I can imagine no basis for dissecting them into their scientific and technological components, for each hears on all. it the industrial and university interests in computers are to be assigned, one to the Ministry of Technology and the other to the Ministry of Education and Science, then the one thing we most need in my opinion—that is to say, unified direction and a national computer policy—will be most difficult to achieve. Either the subject must remain split down the middle, as it were, or we must have an interdepartmental committee or council, or something of that kind, to assign their respective responsibilities to different Ministers of the Crown; and neither of these arrangements is ideal.
As a third illustration I should like to consider the subject of welding. Welding is an almost purely technological subject; a subject where advanced industrial practice is far ahead of education in this particular field. From the educational point of view, welding is still treated as an adjunct to a degree course in metallurgy or engineering, and thought of as some kind of an alternative to riveting. But, from the standpoint of the welding technologist, he has to think in terms of 50 alternative processes of welding, any one of which might be the preferred one to choose in a particular context. Each context needs to be reviewed in terms of design principles appropriate to that particular class of weld. The metallurgy of the weld, the fatigue properties of the weld as opposed to the metal welded. Production engineering, quality control and inspection all come into the subject, and it simply cannot be approached merely as an alternative to riveting.
Provision of the right quality of technological manpower trained in all these subjects must be the province of the Minister for Education and Science. But the technological demands will be voiced through the Ministry of Technology, which will sponsor the British Welding Research Association as one of the industrial research associations which will become its proper responsibility under the proposed arrangements. So once more one foresees the need for some sort of interdepartmental committee to hold the arrangements together and give them a kind of unity.
I do not like this potential proliferation of interdepartmental arrangements. The noble Viscount, Lord Caldecote, asked the rhetorical question: Why is this company necessary? I think he knows as well as I do that the answer often is, to give status to its putative directors. The proliferation of companies and committees has been studied by Professor Parkinson, though whether that belongs to science or technology, I do not know. But I think that these interdepartmental committees are old-fashioned devices based on the concept that interdepartmental matters are second order affairs, small adjustments to solution of problems of primary concern to one or another of two Ministries with a negligible overlap.
In the modern world, my Lords, the heart of many problems lies precisely in the interdepartmental "no-man's land", and our administration ought to reflect it. The work that goes on there does not consist of small adjustments, but often constitutes the kernel of what needs doing. It ought not to be done in shadowy committees, meeting in rooms overdue for decoration, opening out of the "corridors of power". If my noble friend Lord Snow will forgive me when he reads this in Hansard, I cower behind those horrid doors. They need a coat of paint and some windows opening on to the real world.
My Lords, my drawing attention to these difficulties does not mean that they are unresolvable; they only make Government proposals difficult to work; but, given good will, and a lot of hard work on the part of Ministers, they can be made to work. But in bidding farewell to D.S.I.R. (one might almost say that D.S.I.R.'s dies irae has dawned), I think one ought to pay tri jute to the old Department. I am sure that everybody who has ever worked for it, as one of its friendly advisers and helpers from time to time, will, in a way, be sad to see its passing. In any form of corporate reorganisation, division, merger, or whatever it may be, there is always some temporary loss of morale: this is a well recognised sociological phenomenon, none the less real because transient. I hope that Ministers will dc their best to sustain their friends and servants against any sagging of morale as a result of reorganisation. This is part of the price paid for reorganisation. Another part involves cost. If one department is split into two, exactly the same amount of work requires more people to do it. I hope that the price paid in these and other respects that I have mentioned will not be too high.
I should like to close on the same note of warning that I have uttered in every one of our debates on this subject in bygone years. Unless more money is made available, no amount of shifting the departmental furniture around can have the slightest effect. It will all be shadowboxing, as in years gone by, and can but yield a harvest of Dead Sea fruit. If more money is to be spent on science, less money must be spent on something else. Who is going to do without something, and what is he going to do without, in order that scientists can have more to spend—not on themselves, but on the work that they are willing and eager to do for the nation? This is the real essence of the problem facing this Government, as it has faced every Government on every occasion that I have addressed your Lordships' House.

LORD LLEWELYN-DAVIES My Lords, it is a great pleasure as usual to speak after the noble Earl, Lord Halsbury, and I am bound to say that I find myself in very great agreement with many of the things he has said. First, I should like to say that I welcome the action of the Government in setting up the Ministry of Technology. I am no believer in administrative tidiness, and I think that what Lord Halsbury has said about the difficulty of drawing boundary lines is absolutely correct. I think the broad justification for what has been done is the very simple one that, where there is an area which requires immediate and intensive action, it must be singled out and somebody established to cope with it. This evening all I want to do is to call attention to two areas or fields within the broad area of the science-based industries and of technology, which I regard as requiring particular thought and attention from the new Ministry.
The first of these is the field of engineering design. The promotion of research, the advancement of technology, will have its effect on industry, and have its effect on our exports, only if it is transmitted into practice through design. One of the most serious weaknesses in the general technological situation in this country is our failure in design. It is extremely important in the development of our science and technology that we also learn to bridge the gap, both in our education and in the practice of industry, between the thought of the research worker and the action of the designer.
We have had before us the Report of the Fielden Committee, which explores this problem very well; and I was very much struck, when reading that Report, by the evidence given by a Mr. Bosworth, of the General Electric Company, I believe, who pointed out that in industry the function of design had become separated into two different stagings. He said that the first stage tended to be the setting of limits, the specification of the requirements of a product, and that the actual definition of its physical shape, the actual object, was left to another body of men, generally of a lower status in industry, so that the able and brilliant men who had come up through the paths of management and research were concerned with the broad statement of requirements—"the setting of limits", I believe, was the phrase he used—and the translation of that into an actual product was carried out elsewhere by other people. I think that this split or division must be bridged, and I think it is relevant, not merely in the organisation and practice of industry, but also very much in the problem of education.
The noble Lord, Lord Todd, and also the noble Lord, Lord Snow, referred to the alarming shortage of entrants into engineering and technological courses, and this is a matter, obviously, of very grave concern to us all. It is my belief that one of the reasons why these university courses do not attract as many of the right young men as they should is that in this country the national picture of the engineer is divorced from design. This is one of the basic reasons why we do not receive the same intake of really first-rate people into engineering as happens in other countries. If you look to other countries, where the engineer stands higher in public esteem, and where first-rate boys are attracted to engineering, you will find that the idea of the engineer in the public mind is intimately linked with the creative act of making new products in a physical form. I therefore feel that the lesson we have to draw from this is the reintegration of our concept of engineering, both in practice and in education, with the creative act of designing. This is a fundamental point to which I hope the new Ministry will give its attention.
The second matter to which I want to draw attention is one on which I have addressed your Lordships before. It is one of the older industries, the industry of building, and the linked problems with it of architecture and planning. This is an industry which amply or fully illustrates the points made by the noble Earl, Lord Halsbury, in that it is only partly technological. The new Ministry of Technology has taken over, I believe, the Building Research Station, which is for practical purposes the only research institution engaged in work in this field in Great Britain to-day. This institution is a very fine affair, and is engaged in excellent work. There is only one thing wrong with it: it is far too small and far too poor to compete with the problems with which it is supposed to compete.
I believe I am right in saying that the expenditure of D.S.I.R. through the Building Research Station on research in this area of national interest is about one-tenth that of the expenditure on agricultural research, although the net outputs of the two industries are roughly equal. And, further, that whereas research in other fields has been increasing pari passu with the increase in the national product, in this area it has actually been stationary or slightly falling back. It is therefore abundantly clear that this is an industry which should not be left in those fields recommended by the noble Lord, Lord Todd, as fields for inaction. I know it is not an export industry, but, as has been pointed out in the Report by "Neddy", it is an industry whose failure to increase productivity in the next few years could inhibit the national growth that we need, so that indirectly it appears to me to be as vital as any other.
The problems of this industry, as has been pointed out in the Trend Report, cannot be dissociated from problems in the area of housing, planning and land use. It is not much use mounting a massive Programme of research into the best way of prefabricating houses unless we know the kind of houses we are going to build and where we are going to build them. Therefore, we have here an integrated field which will stretch beyond the boundaries of the present technological interests of the Ministry. This is perhaps underlined by the fact that a Committee set up by the former Government, under the noble Lord, Lord Heyworth, which is looking into the social sciences, is in fact taking evidence and will report on major aspects of housing and planning as well as other social aspects; and clearly we cannot expect the integrated drive which we need in this area of national interest until the Heyworth Committee's Report has been received and digested. But at that point I hope that we shall see the fruitful interaction between the noble Lord, Lord Bowden, and Professor Blacken, who have been so eloquently cast by the noble Lord, Lord Snow, as the Castor and Pollux of science and technology.

LORD PEDDIE: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Todd, deserves the thanks of this House for introducing a subject which is of tremendous importance and significance, not only to industry but to the nation itself. I shall endeavour, so far as possible, in making comment on this subject, not to repeat any of the valuable arguments hat have already been advanced in support of the extension of the application of technology to industry.
I think that every noble Lord who has spoken in this debate has given evidence of the need for more rapid introduction of technology in industry; and there has already Seen an indication that over the past years, and particularly since 1950, the economic growth rate and the growth of productivity per head of the workers is lower in Britain than in any other industrial country. It would be wrong to try to attribute that to any single cause. It would be wrong to attribute it solely to the reluctance on the part of some industrialists to go ahead with greater and faster acceptance of better technological processes; but the absence of emphasis on the introduction of new processes and new technology is perhaps the major reason why Britain lags behind in its productivity rate.
It is essential, however, to emphasise that technology should be expressed in many different forms. Mechanisation, automation, and even work study, have their technological expression; and it it interesting to note, when one surveys the industrial field and examines the extent to which there is an acceptance of new technological processes, the enormous variation (this is a point that I think has been brought out in the debate) between different industries in the speed of introduction of new ideas, and also the variation in the rate of acceptance of new ideas by firms within the same industry. A survey recently undertaken established quite clearly the close correlation which exists between the willing acceptance of new ideas in industry and the profitability of those enterprises. I think that is the most important aspect of any consideration of this matter. Therefore, one factor governing growth is speed in introducing new innovations.
A great deal has been said in the course of this debate about the encouragement of basic research; and I join in urging developments in this direction. But it would be wrong to assume that the whole of our development of technology in this country is dependent solely upon the development of basic research. For instance, when we examine the records of Japan and Germany, we find that their relative expenditure on basic scientific research is far lower than it is in Britain. Yet their application of technology to industry is at a faster rate. They are giving far more consideration to the application of scientific methods than to expenditure upon basic research. Therefore, while basic research is important, the application of science to industry is a matter that requires far greater attention than has yet been given to it.
My Lords, we have in this country at the moment full employment. It is an ideal that has been sought for years, and probably we have got closer to full employment than at any time since the Industrial Revolution. Everyone welcomes it; everyone feels that a policy should be pursued that would retain full employment within industry. Parallel with full employment, we also have pressure for shorter hours. And the combination of those two factors makes it clear that there is little opportunity for productivity growth without a larger working force. There appears to be little opportunity of securing a greater total working force in terms of population.
Increased productivity through increased human effort is possible; but exceedingly slow. I am sure that those of your Lordships who, like myself, have had some experience of the introduction of work-study schemes will know how difficult it is, how tedious it is, how slow and laborious it is, to develop work-study schemes with the hope of improving personal, human productivity. One meets the obstacles of inertia, suspicion, a conservative attitude, sometimes among the employers but frequently among the men themselves.
Therefore, my Lords, the only rapid way of securing a substantial increase in production is by better tools and more efficient machinery. This, of course, demands scientific knowledge and the engineers to apply it. But I would reiterate that there is grave danger in believing that it is only our paucity of scientific knowledge and a shortage of engineering skill that restrict a rapid technological advance. A much more important factor is the willingness and ability on the part of industry to apply even known new technological processes. I believe it is wrong to assume that at any point of time—and this is a mater which the new Ministry must take into consideration—it is advantageous to industrialists to use more expensive machinery. It must be made sufficiently profitable to justify the capital investment.
I was interested in the comments of the noble Viscount, Lord Caldecote, who made reference to the need for the utilisation of taxation processes in order to encourage the development of more and better machinery in industry. It is a pity that the Government of his Party did not always practise, when they were in power, what they preach. Indeed, the record there would indicate a great deal of variation, of "Stop" and "Go", in the policy with regard to encouragement of capital expenditure. Frequently we find in the mind of the industrialist an attitude of consideration of whether marginal efficiency of the capital he contemplates employing is too low to justify investment.
In the United States, with their very high labour costs, the economic advantage of machine introduction becomes perfectly obvious; thousands of individual deci- sions of industrialists result in a far higher investment rate per worker than we find in Britain. Thus, in the United States they benefit from the ascending spiral of greater investment, greater productivity, higher wages for labour and renewed pressure for more and continued investment. But what do we have in Britain: the operation of a vicious circle. Although it is often claimed by industrialists that wages are too high for us to be competitive in the world's markets, yet the benefit of substituting machines for labour is not always sufficient to lead to approval of investment in machines.
My Lords, that is the situation which I believe the new Ministry, which I welcome, will have to tackle. We have the example in this country to-day of the pools promoter being in a better position to use computers than the textile mills are to use new and efficient looms. So long as conditions of that kind are allowed to continue, obviously there will be restriction upon the economic development of the nation. Therefore, I heartily endorse the reference to the question of direction which was made by the noble Lord who introduced the Motion. The new Ministry should have the courage not only to select industries for development but also to restrict those industries that do not make, and are unlikely to make, a contribution to the economic development of the country. A sense of direction, definite direction, in the operation of the new Ministry is of vital importance. Without it they cannot succeed. The basic problem is to increase the profitability of application in those fields where lies the greatest national interest. Indeed, I am told that in Italy, the Italian Government have for some time done a great deal to promote low costs by financing industrial plants in these industries that have a high export record.
Thus I want to give emphasis to the comments I make. Although we are speaking of science and technology, we must remember that there are a combination of economic circumstances that frequently restrict the profitability of technological advance and the acceptance of new technology in particular industries. Therefore, the Government policy is of vital importance. That is why I welcome the coming of this Ministry. It will focus attention upon these basic problems and difficulties which at the present moment appear to restrict the extended application of technology to industry.
But, my Lords, I would emphasise one point: that there is a need to coordinate. I do not think the Ministry of Technology alone will ever have the ability or the means to deal with all the problems that are attendant upon the development of new technological processes. No one Ministry can do it. Let me give one illustration of what I mean—there are many others. The Minister of Labour will shortly, I hope, be introducing in industry a system of redundancy payments for displaced workers. This is very important and it should be universally applied. I personally take pride in seeing two years of negotiations with tie unions in the organisation with which I am associated bearing fruit in a first-class agreement on severance payments. I welcome this because it facilitates the movement of labour. But I also recognise that if the weight of the cost of labour replacement, which obviously redundancy payments will involve, increase I without compensatory factors it would merely add further disability to a e employment of machines. Therefore, it becomes necessary for the Ministry concerned with the encouragement of new technological processes to take into account the many different aspects of the question, scientific, economic and the like.
I am glad that one or two noble Lords this afternoon brought out the necessity of increased co-operation between the different Ministries, not only in terms of research, but also along the lines I have mentioned. I can appreciate that my noble friend Lord Snow, in his brilliant argument in support of the establishment of the new Ministry, was not able to give a detailed statement of its policy in the immediate future. I am quite certain from what he has said that behind the urge that promoted his Ministry lies the determination to deal with some of the problems I have mentioned.
What needs to be done immediately? It is necessary to accelerate the study of the practical application of scientific research. In every debate on this subject, I have listened to in this House in past years there has been a great deal of emphasis upon basic scientific research, This is important, of course; but it is even more important in the short period—and the short period is of vital importance to this country—to give greater attention to the practical application of what we know, and not merely to the study of what we may be able to find out in the years to come.
Secondly, it is necessary to bring the universities closer to industry. I believe that one of the minor reasons why new technical processes are not more welcome is that many of those in management to-day have been brought up in the old school and look with some measure of suspicion upon these new ideas. I hope that in future the recruitment from the universities of management with a new and fresher attitude towards the new techniques will mean a step forward in the more willing acceptance of new technical ideas. I think that this will be increasingly a university responsibility.
I should like the Minister to give some attention now to making available to smaller firms the advantages of technological development. In recent months the organisation with which I am associated have given a great deal of thought to the application of computers to the routine scheduling of vehicles. This is quite a simple matter, but it is one that could mean the saving of thousands of man hours. I believe that it is possible to give smaller concerns the benefits of the computer research that is available to larger ones, and that it is necessary for the Government themselves, through this Ministry, to try to establish a method which will enable medium-sized and even small concerns to take immediate advantage of all that science has to offer to-day. In short, putting it in broad terms, we have to make it more profitable to use the machine.
There is a great deal of fear of the machine, a justifiable one so far as labour is concerned because working people do not need to have long memories to recollect the time when the machine put them out of work. We must have proper assurances that the machine will add to the general wealth of the country, increase living standards, stimulate the demand for more goods and, in the long run, create more employment. But there is still this fear of the machine. Ned Ludd, or the spirit of Ned Ludd, is still alive, and to-day we see him as frequently sitting in the boss's chair as standing at the worker's bench. Therefore, whilst there is a resistance to machines on the part of organised labour in many industries, let us also keep in mind that there is a great deal of resistance, sometimes through ignorance, on the part of the employers themselves.
I echo what has been said by many noble Lords in wishing well to this new Ministry. Difficult though their job will be, there is no doubt that the future prosperity and welfare of the entire nation depends upon the spirit and ability with which this country and our industries are able to take full advantage of the new technological knowledge of to-day.

LORD BALERNO My Lords, I wish to draw attention to the problems of the education of young persons for technology and engineering. In Scotland a serious development has recently been uncovered and, if it is not checked, it may lead to a grave shortage in the entry to the universities of students to study mathematics, physics and engineering. The noble Lord, Lord Todd, Chancellor of the University of Strathclyde, brought this to our attention in his speech. The Vice-Chancellor of the University of Edinburgh, Sir Edward Appleton, has drawn attention to it in these words: Young people are tending not to offer higher mathematics in the Scottish Certificate of Education examination as frequently as they did only a few years ago. The number offering higher mathematics has dropped from 40 per cent. in 1962 to 34 per cent. in this year. In the University of Edinburgh this has resulted in vacant places in science and engineering, for, to quote Sir Edward: not enough qualified young people have chosen to come along to occupy them. The result is that the forecast of the Government's Advisory Council on Scientific Policy, to the effect that by the later s we shall have all the scientists and engineers we need, is most likely to be in error. Nobody seems to be at all clear as to the reason for this turn away from mathematics and science on the part of so many school children. In Scotland, at any rate, this shortage is particularly felt in the engineering profession, where there are complaints of lack of quality as well as of quantity.
One reason may well be the scarcity of jobs in Scotland for scientists and engineers, a point to which some publicity has recently been given. The noble Lords, Lord Todd and Lord Snow, have raised the question of the relative status of the scientist and the engineer. I think that the climate is changing. The noble Lord, Lord Snow, has referred to the recent decision of the Royal Society of London to increase the number of the Fellows they elect each year in order to include many more applied scientists. But why does the Council hesitate to describe them as technologists and engineers? In the U.S.A.—a point to which the noble Viscount, Lord Mills, drew our attention—there are many examples where in universities the technologists and engineers have from their work given real impetus to fundamental scientific discovery.
Then there is another prestige point—the status of the colleges of technology, which, at any rate in Scotland, come under the local education authorities. We must enhance their status so that they are not considered as continuation schools. They must develop a corporate spirit. Let them have blazers and badges. And I beseech the local authorities to appoint as governors men of standing and independence, and to see that the work of governing these colleges is not that of just another committee of already overworked members of the education authority.
The sixth form is remarkably quick to discover which departments at its local university are the most severe in their requirements and examinations. Literally an "old boy" and "old girl" net exists. Joe, who left school two years ago and lives down the road, cannot get through his degree examination in maths., while Bill has "flunked" in what should have been his final year in engineering, and, in consequence, is bereft of his Government grant for the year's repeat—Look at his clothes! Again, it may be that the university entrance examinations are biased against the boy or girl with an aptitude for science. Is the language requirement a hindrance? True, in the Scottish universities the standard for language at the lower level is not very exacting; but it does exact. The technical colleges in Scotland do not have this language requirement, and judging from the figures, which I have been given from Heriot-Watt College in Edinburgh, this seems to be no hindrance to success. During the last three years more than 50 per cent. of those who gained the associateship of the College had no language qualifications when they entered, and a proper proportion of them gained first-class and second-class honours. So the language qualification seems unnecessary as an indication of ultimate success in science and engineering. I must declare an interest in this matter and confess that I only gained "A" level in Latin at my third attempt.
Another question: Is the standard required in the English paper too high for those whose natural aptitude is mathematics, thus leading to a disinclination to go to university at till? Nowadays an engineer writes figures but does not write letters; he dictates them. It is quite surprising to find in America so many top executives in industry who seem to be sub-literate, relying on their secretaries, as in the old Country did the Kings and noble Lords of history.
There is also the pint that examiners are not necessarily consistent in their marking of papers, but this hardly applies to the examiners in mathematics and in science. A "borderline" boy is told or discovers that by pertinacity he will strike good luck and get through in history and geography and even Latin, but there is no benefit of the doubt given in failure to solve an equation. On the other hand, in the history paper, which we find discussing the reign of Henry VIII, certain examiners might well give the benefit of the doubt to the boy who comes down heavily in favour of King Henry.
There is also the question of natural (genetic) aptitudes. Are there such animals as natural mathematicians? The opposite, at any rate, seems to be the case, for a paper on entrance requirements which I have recently read says: … candidates who, while gifted academically in other respects, are incapable of profiting from the mathematical/scientific disciplines. Surely the converse of this statement is also true, and that there exist certain young persons with precise minds and a great capacity for mathematics to whom the more philosophic subjects are utterly abhorrent.
It is, however, beyond dispute that the major immediate cause of the trouble is a shortage of good teachers of mathematics in the schools. Mathematics ill taught, or taught in classes that are too large, creates frustration in the boy or girl, with a consequent distaste for the subject. Only the brilliant and bright can survive such teaching conditions. I am informed that Strathclyde University and the Heriot-Watt College, in association with the local teachers' training colleges, have schemes worked out to provide more teachers of mathematics.
My Lords, there are some who attribute this present malaise to the expansion of the universities and technical colleges. The Robbins Report shows clearly that this is not so. The "pool of ability" is, in fact, quite a pond. In Appendix 1 there are some very convincing figures to support the contention that more students need not mean worse students. Nor is there evidence to support the view that more has already meant worse.
To sum up, I would say that the first requirement is to increase the number of teachers of mathematics in the schools. Secondly, we should take a closer look at our system of selection of boys and girls for university education. Some universities use the examination results merely as a sieve, and place greater emphasis on the interview. I wonder whether this is right? Does talent perhaps sometimes leak through the sieve? The present evidence would indicate that quite a lot of potential material is prevented from getting a higher education. To give such young people a higher education might well increase the wastage rate at the universities and colleges—unless the perfect system of selection were discovered. At present the university wastage is of the order of 14 per cent. In technology it is somewhat higher, being around 20 per cent. Compared to other countries, however, these are not high figures, and they can be justified.
My Lords, by accepting the Robbins Report we are committed to producing within sixteen years about 21 times the present number of graduates. But we have no certainty as to the needs of the nation. We are uncertain as to the total number likely to be required, and we have no breakdown into subjects of study. I submit that it is a matter of urgency to set going an investigation and analysis of the national requirements. It is most important to do this in respect of scientists and engineers, but such a survey might with advantage cover a much wider field. At present there is a grave imbalance in these matters. It starts with the boys and girls at school and continues through to what may develop into crucial shortages of those men whose inventiveness and hard work is the very foundation of the national prosperity of this realm.

LORD CHORLEY My Lords, before the noble Lord makes the official reply from the Opposition I should like to occupy five minutes on a point that seems to me to be important; and it is one that I have made on two previous occasions in these technological debates. On neither occasion, during the Administration of the last Government, did I receive any answer whatever from the Leader of the House. A great deal of lip-service is paid in industry to the need for employing scientists and technologists. I believe it is not so much that there is an absence of employing technologists, as that it has become a sort of—I will not say craze, but a fashion, throughout a great deal of industry to employ technologists and scientists but not to give them anything to get their teeth into.
The noble Lord, Lord Peddie, referred to full employment. A great deal of the full employment we have in this country is not properly full employment at all: it is a sort of under-employment, with men not really pulling their weight, though they are on the pay-roll. There is an extraordinarily interesting article on this subject, which I would commend to your Lordships, in tile current issue of Socialist Commentary.
This problem is even worse in industry in respect of technologists and scientists. I meet a number of these young men. I believe that the turnover is tremendous. May I repeat an instance that I gave on the last occasion when I spoke on this matter? In one of the biggest engineering concerns in the country, which runs a special research section, the turnover in two years was complete in regard to the younger men: every single one of them left because he was "browned off" I mentioned on the last occasion that I had discussed this with the Cavendish Professor at Cambridge, and he told me that his impression was exactly the same as mine. He is a particularly eminent man, in touch with these things in a way that I do not pretend to be, and the fact that this was his impression seemed to me to be of real importance. Yet, I repeat, this point was ignored by the Government spokesman on that occasion.
The question really is how are we to deal with this situation. There is no point in turning out thousands of technologists and getting them jobs in industry, if they are not to be effectively employed there. I think my noble friend Lord Snow touched upon this in his speech, but he certainly did not develop the point. It is obviously very difficult to insist that these people shall be effectively employed. We must, somehow or other, get technologists and engineers into the higher echelons of industry rather than so many of the people who are now recruited because of their family position or, possibly, because they are good accountants, or have a reputation on the financial side, or something of that sort. I believe that Imperial Chemical Industries have been for many years an exception to what I have been saying, because they always have a number of eminent scientists and technologists on their board, and they are able to see that the technologists employed in that great concern are effectively employed. Somehow or other we must get the same sort of spirit and method of doing business into all our industrial concerns.
This is really another aspect of the debate we had two or three weeks ago, about the need for setting up industrial and business colleges. The people who go through these colleges have somehow or other to he infused with the realisation that it is not just a matter of bringing in technologists at lower levels in industry and having them on the weekly pay-roll: they must be employed effectively. I am sure that this is a very important aspect of this matter, and I hope that the noble Lord who is to reply for the Government will he able to throw some light on the method of dealing with it, because I have not been able to find one.

THE EARL OF BESSBOROUGH My Lords, like other Members of your Lordships' House, I should like to pay a tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Todd, for putting this Motion down on the Order Paper. The noble Lord's long experience and his long service as Chairman of the Advisory Council on Scientific Policy make his remarks particularly interesting. I think that, of all the speeches which he has made in this House, this may have been one of the most illuminating, because, being no longer Chairman of the Council, he may have felt able to speak a little more freely than he might have done had he still held that office.
Having learned something over the past year—and it his been a very hard working year, with a great deal of homework—of the subjects about which the noble Lord has spoken, I should like, first of all, to say a word about development contracts which, as I think the noble Lord agreed—and he must know—were proposed as long ago as 1952. But I think he also agrees that they have not so far been very successful in this country. This, I think, is in contrast with the situation in the United States of America, where the development contract is the principal means by which the Government supports research in industry. I must admit that, having been in America quite recently, it would seem to me that the development contracts system works fairly effectively there, and seems to ensure that industry keeps in the forefront research and development. In this country, for example, the Atomic Energy Authority undertakes research on its own. In the United States, the Atomic Energy Commission does not. The A.E.C. is an administrative and executive body only, and the research is wholly undertaken by firms with whom the A.E.C. places its development contracts, with the result that Union Carbide, for instance, is wholly responsible for the operation of the Atomic Energy Commission's main research establishment, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee.
I am not proposing, any more than any other noble Lords, that we should try to transplant American systems over here. I am merely saying that the development contracts system in America is widespread, although it is true that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration do a certain amount of research of their own, rather as the Atomic Energy Authority does in this country, but not, I think, in so large a proportion. At all events, from what I saw in America I should not like to think that we in this country were rejecting the principle of development contracts altogether, and I think it is clear from Government statements that the Government agree with this. But I should be interested to hear the further views of the noble Lord, Lord Bowden, on this matter.
I suppose the fact that so much research here is already done by what I might describe as para-statal authorities and research councils and research stations supported by Government funds, would make it difficult to switch over to a development contracts system. Several noble Lords, perhaps, know more about this than 1 do, but this is the observation which I have made in comparing the system in America and Britain. Undoubtedly, in America they get industry itself to play a greater and more responsible part in research. I am sure that my noble friends opposite must be giving this matter very careful consideration. I think our own system has worked well in the past and, indeed, our research councils and research associations are envied by many of our American friends. But the evolution in the organisation of science and technology in this country must not stand still, and we must look carefully at every alternative method by which industry can be brought to benefit from the fruits of research.
I am glad to see that, apart from the creation of the new Ministry of Technology, the Government, in their new Science and Technology Bill, follow very much on the lines of the last Government's proposals arising out of the Trend Report. None the less, I think we must keep a close watch on what is happening abroad, not only in America, but also in Germany, where the development contract is also widely used. I would also say that, in considering the work of the new Science Research Council, I hope that full account will be taken of the experience of the National Science Foundation in America, which is so very much concerned with research work in the universities and which also, incidentally, plans to award 50 to 60 Fellowships to senior foreign scientists in the present academic year. I only wish that this country could afford to do the same in reverse.
The noble Lord, Lord Todd, also referred to the activities of the N.R.D.C. which, I think it is true to say, have not been very successful, except on a relatively small scale. In that connection I was interested to look back on the Labour Manifesto, The New Britain, where it said on page 9 that the N.R.D.C. which had been created by the former Labour Government, had already led to scores of new products and processes, of which the hovercraft and the Atlas computer were interesting examples. This seemed to me to be rather a misleading generalisation: "scores of new products and processes." Is a score 20, or does it mean that there were 40 new processes, or what? From my experience, apart from the hovercraft and the Atlas computer (which I think probably originated elsewhere) and a pill which originated with the Medical Research Council—that was "pinched" from the M.R.C.—I do not know that the N.R.D.C. has really done a great deal. But I hope the present Government will be able to put that right. I wanted to make the point that sometimes the Government give us very misleading generalisations.
I also noticed the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Todd, about the research associations. During my year's term of office I visited a considerable number of them, and there is no doubt at all that while some are doing an extremely good job, others have their problems. But, by and large—and this is very much of a generalisation—I think noble Lords will agree that where industry itself gives substantial support to their particular research association, then the climax in which they do their work seems very favourable and the results more successful. The relationship of the research associations with the universities should also, in my view, be further examined. In the case of units of the Medical and Agricultural Research Councils, which I also visited, and which are wholly grant-aided by the Government (they are not co-operative ventures as are the research associations), I got the impression that relations with the universities in most cases were excellent, and especially in those cases where a high percentage of their research was fundamental rather than applied.
I do not think that I could say that there were quite such close relations with the universities in the case of all the research stations of the D.S.I.R. and the research associations, although I can think of one research association which is, in fact, located within a university; and there are others where the links with universities are satisfactory. But I should particularly like to ask the Government this question—and I have given the noble Lord notice of this: what exactly do they propose to do about the research associations? My first question is thus quite a simple one. In a Written Answer given by the Secretary of State for Education and Science in another place on Thursday, November 26, it was not stated which Department would he responsible for them in Parliament. I daresay that it is, in fact, the Ministry of Technology; but that was not stated. Nor is this actually stated in the recently published Science and Technology Bill. However, the noble Lord need not bother to reply later to that question, as he has just indicated that it is Lord Snow's Department that will be responsible for them.
If I may be allowed to do so, I should like to cite another example of experience gained by our American friends. In addition to development contracts, there are other ways, as noble Lords may know, in which industry and the universities maintain close relations in that country. One is by research fellowships in a whole range of post-graduate studies. These fellowships are endowed by industrial firms in the universities themselves. They are widespread in America—more so, I think, than in this country—and there is no doubt that they must pay considerable dividends to the firms concerned.
There are also other interesting situations in American universities. I think, for example, of Stanford University, in which a group of carefully selected industries build their plants in a park around the univerisity to conform (I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Llewelyn-Davies, is here) to certain architectural standards. They are research plants. The universities devise the research courses for post, graduate engineers, for example, and this enables them to keep abreast of the latest developments in their particular speciality. Industry, rather than the universities, supports them, and the courses are in each case tailor-made to suit requirements. The services of the university staff are available in a consultative capacity, and this, of course, is less costly for industry which would otherwise have to hire their services.
Then also, as the noble Lord, Lord Bowden, knows, there are the contracts placed by Government agencies with the universities themselves. An interesting example was cited by the noble Lord, Lord Bowden, in the colour supplement of the Observer this week, in which the Massachusetts Institute of Technology obtained a contract to investigate the problem of transportation in the Boston-Washington corridor. I do not know whether M.I.T. provided a better solution of this problem than our own Road Research Laboratory would have done, but the principle is an interesting one. We must look at what is going on there. As the noble Lord knows about this example I shall be interested in his comments.
I believe that the noble Lord would also agree that it is always worth while to look at what is happening in America. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Snow, is particularly knowledgeable about how the Soviet Union tackle these problems. He did not speak to us about it, but possibly the noble Lord, Lord Bowden, is also familiar with them and will also tell us. I wonder, in fact, how successful the Russians have been. At all events, anything that can be done to bring Government stations, universities and industry even closer together will, I am certain, pay dividends; and in the case of applied research, the more industry feels able to invest in our own research associations, the better. The last Government did all they could to encourage this, especially in those industries made up of relatively small firms which cannot afford to undertake expensive research on their own. One thing that is important is that we should at all costs try to avoid the kind of situation in which, perhaps, American industry takes up a process which has been conceived or evolved in one of our own establishments. I hope that noble Lords opposite will look very carefully at this point, because an unhappy situation could arise.
The public image of technology, a point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Todd, is a most important subject, and it was very much the concern of my right honourable friend in another place. Together we did everything possible to encourage the popularisation of mechanical engineering and other technologies, including chemistry and electronics, and those in which there were shortages. The B.B.C. and the Independent Television companies responded enthusiastically to this call, with the result, as was pointed out in your Lordships' House only last week, that a number of programmes, such as "Towards 2000" and many others, have now been produced, and are undoubtedly helping to stress the popular appeal—shall I say, the romance?—in the life and work of a mechanical engineer. I hope that noble Lords opposite will continue to urge the mass media to present engineering problems in reasonably popular form, and also in ways and at times that will enable boys and girls at school to absorb them.
I hope that noble Lords opposite will also agree to encourage professors of engineering at the universities to visit schools more frequently, with the object of stimulating more boys to take up engineering rather than pure science or the arts. I feel sure, too, that the Government will agree that greater efforts should be made to improve the quality of science teaching in schools. In travelling up and down the country over the past year I have frequently stressed these points. Although I have in the past been associated more with the arts than with science and technology, I have during the last year been doing my utmost to combat the snob appeal which is associated with the arts, because, as we all know, we are in this country short of mechanical engineers and certain other technologists which I have mentioned.
When I look at these problems I sometimes feel that the arts are almost a kind of indulgence. I might add that only a small percentage of girls seem to go in for these subjects, although they have an important contribution to make in research establishments and laboratories. I think not only of Madame Curie and of Dorothy Crowfoot-Hodgkins, winner of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry only the other day, but also of women (there are not many of them) like my great grandmother, Charlotte Guest. She was perhaps the most practical woman of her age and was capable not only of applying science but also of running most efficiently, and in a most enlightened way, a vast industry in South Wales and a firm which provided all the rails for the Trans-Siberian Railway. Women can do it, if they will.
The noble Lord, Lord Todd, also stressed what has been said before in your Lordships' House, that there should be a greater ease of transfer from science to technology in universities. I have raised this point before in other debates. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Bowden, is sympathetic to it, and I hope that he will tell us how he can encourage this. The noble Lord, Lord Todd, may yet be right when he says that technological subjects will continue to lack glamour unless strong research schools are developed alongside and within our universities. The whole future of Britain depends on our scientific and technological manpower. It depends, I believe, more upon this than upon anything else. I know this from my visits to the United States, Germany and to Russia. Our own people must all be brought to recognise this fact, and I am sure noble Lords are with me in regard to this.
When I was recently visiting the Manned Spacecraft Centre at Houston in Texas, I also visited Rice University. The noble Lord, Lord Snow, may know it. Rice is now establishing its own Space Science Faculty, and I was glad to read recently that, I think, Bristol University was to set up a similar department. I do not think we should forget space research, even if we cannot afford to indulge in it so extensively as the United States or the U.S.S.R. We have indeed made important contributions; I have quoted them on other occasions. When one goes to America one finds they are more numerous than one thought. There is no doubt, as the noble Lord, Lord Todd, has said to me, that space science greatly appeals to the young. I might add it also appeals to some who are older and yet perhaps young in heart.
Above all, though, I would endorse Lord Todd's plea—this is, of course, a controversial matter—that science and technology are so interwoven that the two should be integrated. I am not necessarily saying how many Ministers there should be. But the two should be integrated. There may be a danger in separation, and there may be a good case for science and technology going to one Minister, rather than two. On the whole, I agree with the noble Earl, Lord Halsbury, as to exactly where the split should be. I do not think science and technology itself can be split very effectively; there are other points where the split is more effective. At all events, I should like to know from the Government how the new Minister of Technology and the other Ministers associated with him—I gather there are six or seven in all—are going to tackle the problems which we all know exist. How will they get industry to make greater use of research facilities? How will they increase the number of mechanical engineers?
It is all very well to establish a new Department, but what exactly is it going to do? I think several noble Lords—certainly the noble Viscount, Lord Caldecote—referred to an answer given last Thursday by the Prime Minister in another place; he said that the Ministry of Technology had the general responsibility of guiding and stimulating a major national effort to bring advanced technology and new processes into British industry. This is, of course, what we all need, and we have no quarrel with that. He went on, however, to refer to the methods which it was proposed to employ. He said they would include an intensified use of the appropriate research stations and of the N.R.D.C., that civil development contracts would also be used, and—this was the method which mystified me most; this is what Lord Caldecote also quoted—he said the methods would include studies to identify particular industries or parts of industries suitable for action. What action? Does this mean that certain further industries are liable—
LORD SNOW My Lords, may I interrupt the noble Earl? There is nothing at all sinister in this remark. Parts of industry suitable for action are suitable for development contracts or the absence of development contracts, for the use of purchasing power or the absence of purchasing power, and possibly other devices of the type mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Todd. There is nothing whatever sinister in this remark.
THE EARL OF BESSBOROUGH I am extremely grateful to the noble Lord for giving me this assurance, because I was looking back at what the Prime Minister said when he was Leader of the Opposition. It was October, 1961, when he said: The N.R.D.C. should have the right in a backward or declining industry to establish publicly-owned or competitive State factories. I am quoting the words precisely, That was what the Prime Minister said in October, 1961; therefore I was in a little doubt when I then read those words on Thursday; I wondered whether the Prime Minister had not also got his former words in his mind when he gave that answer. But I am glad to have that assurance from the noble Lord.
I must say that I was also interested in Clause 5(1)(b) of the Bill on Science and Technology, which states that: The Secretary of State and the Minister may defray out of monies provided by Parliament any expenses which with the consent of the Treasury they may respectively incur: (b) as regards the Minister"— that is, the Minister of Technology— In furthering the practical application of the results of scientific research. How are the Government going to further these practical applications? I should be most interested to hear from the noble Lord on that point.
I will not go into detail in regard to integration between the Council for Scientific Policy and the new Technological Council. It is clear they should be integrated, and I hope there will be cross-representation on them, integrated as the two Ministries, I hope, will be integrated. I think these two Councils should work together, and I hope at least there will some co-ordination. Even so, I am, I am afraid, a little dubious about the whole set-up. Is this a case of streamlining the administration; as the Prime Minister proposed to do, or is it merely a further enlargement of a Socialist bureaucracy? It might, I think, have been possible to have a Council for Scientific Policy and a Technological Council for the proposed Industrial Research Development Authority. But I should like to know how the noble Lord thinks these two Councils will operate under separate Ministers. I should also like to mention the technical information services for industry and the extension of the industrial liaison facilities through the colleges of advanced technology and the technical colleges. Your Lordships may recall that earlier this year I announced in this House the initiation of a scheme for extending these facilities, and I am glad that during the year the scheme has progressed.
As your Lordships know, there are D.S.I.R. branch offices in Cardiff, Edinburgh and Newcastle. Indeed the D.S.I.R. has for many years paid close attention to the means of encouraging industry, and particularly the smaller firms, to utilise as fully as possible the results of research and development. What is to happen to these branch offices? I suppose they will remain under the Department of Technology. I do not want to think of them as the poor relatives of my noble friends. The most effective means of increasing the flow of technical information into such firms has undoubtedly been to arrange visits by these liaison officers. Liaison centres have also been established at certain CATS and technical colleges with officers manning them as members of the staff of the colleges. In their task of keeping industry informed of the many scientific and technical resources which are available to it, these officers draw attention to the facilities of the college. The officers also have limited lecturing commitments in introducing into the appropriate courses some topics related to the objectives of the centres. There are now ten of these centres in England and Wales and a further eleven are being established in accordance with the plans of extension which my right honourable friend and I announced in January.
In addition there are five such centres in Scotland, and there are the four technical regional information service centres which are as far as possible being assimilated into the newer industrial liaison centre scheme. All this is, I think, very promising, and I hope the Government will encourage even further extensions as they become practical, and I should like to know whether they would propose to do that. I think the situation in the CATS and technical colleges is now becoming satisfactory, and I hope also other universities will benefit from these services.
As it is a fairly late hour, I will not burden your Lordships with any further observations, except to repeat what I said in the debate on the Address about the high standing of British science and technology in the world to-day. I stand by the remarks which I made then. I am glad that we have heard again from the noble Lord, Lord Snow, whose admirable maiden speech greatly impressed your Lordships, as also did his speech to-day.
Having, some two months ago spent two hours debating at Rice University in Houston the problems of science and government arising out of the noble Lord's book of that name, and lately having had a conversation with him, I know that these problems are indeed close to his heart, as they are to that of the noble Lord, Lord Bowden. The noble Lord, Lord Snow, made that clear in his speech this afternoon. I am sure that he would not wish your Lordships to judge him purely as a successful novelist, which he undoubtedly is. Like many of your Lordships, I have enjoyed reading his novels and seeing dramatisations of them; but he has considerable academic and industrial experience and I have been equally interested to listen to him on the topics which your Lordships have been debating so ably this afternoon.
I was most interested in the remarks of my noble friend Lord Caldecote, who I hope will forgive me for mentioning him last. It was his maiden speech, too, from this Box, and I think he should be congratulated on what he said. Like my right honourable friend Mr. Marples, who speaks on technology for the Opposition in another place, my noble friend has for some time had practical experience in industry and has been busy running an important section of British business, in a firm with which the noble Lord, Lord Snow, is not, I think, unfamiliar.
It is undoubtedly the practical approach which we need, and that, I may say, is the theme of the Conservative Party. On the other hand, the theme of the present Government seems so often to be purely theoretical. If they try to apply some of their theories in practice we shall certainly jump down their throats; otherwise we shall, I hope, remain friendly. Having also made my first speech from this particular Bench I should like to crave your Lordships' indulgence to say that I believe, with Sir Leon Bagrit, that we should have at the head of affairs science-orientated humanists or, if I might perhaps vary this, humanistically-orientated scientists. I think we may have these. I believe that in considering the state of technical development in this country we should not forget the inspiration which the Arts can give us. The two cultures must not be separated; they must remain, as Leonardo da Vinci kept them, as close as possible together.

LORD BOWDEN My Lords, this has been a most extraordinarily interesting and memorable debate. I am sure that all your Lordships would wish me to express our thanks to the noble Lord, Lord Todd, for initiating the debate and for the extremely impressive speech which he made. So much of it—in fact, almost all parts of it could, I think, have been equally appropriately made from any of the Benches in this House. It is clear, I think, that we all feel much alike on most of the problems which have been our concern this afternoon. In thanking Lord Todd for the speech that he made, I feel that I should also thank him for the work that he has done during the last twelve years as Chairman of the A.C.S.P., a body which has had a most profound influence on the whole of the scientific policy of this country. The opinions of the A.C.S.P. have, in large measure, been determined by its Chairman, who voiced them for so long in this House and elsewhere. As I have said, we are much of a mind on most of what he said.
I think it is worth while briefly to put our problems into proper perspective. We in this country are in a difficult situation to-day, and it is important to realise just why our situation has in fact eventuated. If I may quote from a celebrated Member of this House, once Prime Minister, Lord Balfour, he said: The educational system of this country is chaotic, is ineffectual, is utterly behind the age. It makes us the laughing stock of every advanced country in Europe and in America. It puts us behind not only our American cousins, but the Germans, the Frenchmen and the Italians. He added: This is an age of modern artillery, and we turn out boys to do battle with it. equipped with the sword and shield of an ancient gladiator. This was the situation which Lord Balfour described after he had left office.
A situation as difficult as that is bound to take a long time to recover from. But there is no doubt at all that at this moment the universities and all that they stand for are tremendously in the public mind. I find from my statisticians that in the last month Her Majesty's Stationery Office has published five volumes containing 1,490 pages, which I am assured weigh no less than 4 lb. 9 oz., about the general problems of the universities and their development. They are in fact greatly in the public mind, and it is important to realise just what we are in process of doing.
I think it fair to say that at this moment the plant (if I can without offence so describe it) of our English universities is probably worth about £300 million all in. I am making no allowance in this figure for an estimated cost of replacing King's College, Cambridge, but £300 million is about the value of our English university buildings and equipment. During the course of the next ten or fifteen years (during which time I presume that the present Government will be in charge of affairs) we shall probably spend about as much again: in other words, the total amount of money to be spent on the universities in the next dozen or so years is about equal to the value of the universities to-day; and in the next ten or fifteen years—again it is impossible to give precise figures—the number of students who go into our universities will be about as many as have gone through all the English universities since the far off days when a few scholars fled from Paris and scaled in the swamps near Oxford.
The English universities are growing as never before. There can be no doubt that, at long last, -heir importance is properly realised. It is only a few years ago since I achieved a certain notoriety, which I have subsequently shuddered at, by pointing out that the Government of that time were spending considerably more on the egg subsidy than on the universities. I am glad to say that this situation has been transformed, and although eggs are costing rather less than they did, the universities are costing four or five times as much as they did in 1957. On the other hand, having said that, I should add that we still have to contend with the problem that, magnificent though these efforts may be, ambitious though our plans may be, we may not necessarily be doing all that we should do.
This poses the extremely important problem to which several noble Lords have referred this afternoon: the difficulty of recruiting as members of the departments of mathematics, physics, chemistry and engineering, young men in sufficient numbers. Several noble Lords have already said, quite truly (I have figures with me, but there is no point in reading them now), that there are a large number of vacancies in the departments of science and technology—there are more men in place, but there are more vacancies than there were last year; whereas almost every department of the faculties of arts and classics and of medicine is full and overflowing. This raises a difficult and complex issue—namely, how are we to try to persuade students to read these important subjects?
The situation is in many ways fundamentally unstable, for a perfectly obvious reason. If I may choose mathematics as typifying any subject which may be important, as soon as the demand for mathematicians in industry increases, immediately the better men cease to become schoolmasters and become mathematicians in industry. Immediately, then, the quality of teaching in schools declines; the number of schoolboys coming forward declines; the number of seats in a university department declines, and the situation gets rapidly worse. We have in our present system of education a fundamental instability which tends to exaggerate any deficiency and immediately makes it worse. On the other hand, it would be regarded by everybody, and rightly so, as undesirable that students should be directed to read a particular subject. We have here the fundamental dilemma which besets any academic administrator who is trying to decide how best to organise the English educational machine.
This is not a problem which is unique to this country. It has been intensively studied both in Russia and in America. The techniques which are used for solving it in neither country can be held to be satisfactory, but I should like briefly to describe them to your Lordships, for you may find them interesting. In Russia they have an extremely elaborate system by which they control the expansion of their universities. They have set up a very comprehensive manpower survey organisation, which attempts to predict the demand for different types of scholar for a period of a few years ahead. They have, in fact, a running forecast for five years at a time. I spoke at length with Mr. Rudnev, the Deputy Prime Minister responsible for making this forecast. He frankly admitted that it was virtually impossible to produce reliable figures. It is not possible to decide this even in Russia, a country whose future is more or less internally controlled in the sense that ours is not; for they are not an exporting nation, whereas we are. Furthermore, a system which is adequate for five years hence, may prove to be quite wrong twenty years hence. This they clearly understand. But equally, they clearly understood that to make some attempt to control the entry into universities is far better than to make none; because they may be wrong, but they would not be grotesquely wrong, as we quite easily could be.
Our own universities are expanding according to a process which Lord Robbins in his Report presumed to be the only one we could adopt. Your Lordships may remember that the Robbins Committee decided that it was not possible in this country to predict the demand for different kinds of scholar, so that the only thing to do was to allow students to choose freely which disciplines they wished to study when they arrived in the university.
This idea appears at first sight to be the only equitable, fair and English way: but when one comes to consider its implications it is far less attractive than at first sight appears, because the choice which determines the faculty to which a student ultimately goes in a university is nearly always made when he is about fourteen years of age. Thereafter, it is almost impossible for him to change his direction. So it is almost true to say that the destiny of our universities, their whole expansion programme, and with this the whole destiny of this country, is at this moment in the hands of fourteen-year-old schoolboys. This situation is quite intolerable; but, for all that, it is extremely hard to alter it. All I can attempt to say is that we are doing our best—perhaps the noble Lord who is about to say something does not agree with me.
LORD NEWTON My Lords, is the noble Lord really saying that the vast majority of undergraduates and students at university decide what disciplines they are going to study at the age of 14? Did I understand the noble Lord aright?
LORD BOWDEN Yes, you did. They decide which side of the sixth form to go to at that age, and thereafter they are almost irrevocably committed to it. It is extremely hard for a man, who decided to read, say, classics at the age of 14, to switch to mathematics at the age of 17. It is done occasionally, but it is so difficult that this is to all intents and purposes true.
Some of your Lordships may have seen the extremely interesting survey which was recently made by the Institute of Chemical Engineers, who attempted to discover the motives which led people who read chemical engineering to choose that particular subject when they had entered university. It was perfectly obvious that the decisions were made on an extraordinarily arbitrary basis. Occasionally someone happened to know a chemical engineer; sometimes they used a pin; sometimes careers masters helped them a bit. But the final conclusion is that the choice was, as it were, made in a total fog and in a complete absence of understanding of the principles involved, of the probable value of this particular career, of the interest of the subject or of any other significant parameter.
Here we have one of our greatest educational problems. How are we to try to persuade schoolboys to make the proper choice? How far is it proper, reasonable or tolerable that the policy of university expansion should be controlled, directed, or even influenced by the central Government? The universities are very properly extremely jealous of their autonomy: so, of course, they must be. On the other hand, how far can we, at a time when universities are costing something like £200 million a year, at a time when the destiny of the country is firmly in their hands, ignore the responsibilities of deciding, or of helping them to decide, which departments should be increased, and how far, and how much, restriction should be imposed on others?
The Russians, as I have said, make deliberate attempts to do this. There are always more applications for places than there are places to offer them. The total global figure for the various departments is determined centrally and students compete for places in departments of their choice. So there is a certain measure of direction, minimal but to them inescapably necessary.
One of the problems which we must discuss—I hope to discuss this with Vice-Chancellors before long—is how far is it reasonable and possible to make decisions of this kind. But I have to confess that the very best efforts made so far to produce reliable forecasts for manpower have not been by any means complete, and even if we could do it we should not know how to do it as yet. But it is a problem with which in the next few years the Government—any Government—will have to wrestle, and which all universities will have to consider. Once we have a statistical department in the Government capable of making the forecasts, then and only then will it be possible to have some influence on the growth of our great universities.
In America the final choice of subject is not usually made by a student until lie is in his second or third year in the university. Then it is nearly always made under the influence of estimates of the probable value of his degree after he has left the university. The Americans are much more conscious than we are of the cash value of a degree to a graduate and the extent to which he may hope throughout his lifetime to benefit from the qualifications he gets at university. For this reason the choice of the student is directed at least into those professions whose career prospects are good, even if they are not necessarily the careers which are most socially desirable. There is at least no possibility—a possibility which exists in this country—that all graduates should one year turn out to he ecclesiastical historians. Fortunately this has never happened, but in principle it seems only too possible that it might.
We have been told of the extreme difficulty of getting people adequately qualified in mathematics. I should like at this point to pay a warm tribute to the work which is being clone by the Nuffield Foundation and by Professor Thwaites and one or two other people on the development of courses in mathematics. They are improving the system immensely, and I believe that the advent of new teaching in mathematics is going to have an extraordinary and exhilarating effect on what has hitherto been a rather arid subject, and that perhaps the shortage may not last as long as it otherwise might do. I think it quite remarkable that the Nuffield people should have started this enterprise, and although I could not be sure of the figure I think they must have spent the better part of £1 million, all in all, on developing this most important work.
One noble Lord referred to the problem of the illiterate engineer. It is fashionable to denounce engineers who are unable to express themselves in English; but I myself fear far more the man to whom Providence, in its inscrutable wisdom, has denied the gift of understanding, but whom it has endowed with the gift of speech. These are the men who make unsafe designs and then persuade boards of management to put them into production. There is a time when it is more important to be a good professional engineer than necessarily to be a man of two cultures, however desirable this may be.
My Lords, I am afraid that, unless I take an inordinate time this evening, it will not be possible for me to answer all the questions which noble Lords have posed, but I should like to answer just a few of them. One of the problems which the noble Earl, Lord Bessborough, mentioned was that of development contracts. My Lords, these have a most important effect in the American universities. As the noble Earl very rightly said, the Atomic Energy Commission entrusts the greater part of its work to a few firms and to many universities. It is remarkable to think that all the later stages of the rocket which is just now on its way to Mars, and all the equipment in it, were made to designs produced in California at Cal. Tech. The great atomic energy place at Oakridge, as the noble Earl said, is run by a large industrial firm, but Los Alamos is run by the University of California. This idea of entrusting universities with large development contracts for major pieces of Government work is vitally important, and it has been the making of the great American graduate schools.
As I have said in this House before, the most difficult problem of education to-day is not, I submit, in the schools or in the universities as they are normally thought of, but is in the problem, as the Americans phrase it, of turning college graduates into engineers. How do you make a man understand that engineering is more than the stuff you read in books? How do you make him aware of the fact that it is a method of tackling problems; that science is a way of life rather than a body of knowledge? The only way he can do this is by serving his apprenticeship to a real scientist, a real engineer, doing a real piece of research somewhere. The American Government, realising this, have gone to enormous lengths to make sure that almost all the research which they sponsor is in some way associated with the educational process. I believe that this has been the greatest single source of strength and the most important reason for the rapid growth of the great American graduate schools. So far as we are able to do it, I hope that both the Department of Education and Science and the Ministry of Technology will use the same technique over here.
I can assure your Lordships that the two Ministries are as close together as it is possible for any people to be. I would also try to emphasise the fact that it was not possible to have one Ministry coping with everything. When we really came to decide where this indivisible rôle must be divided, we were confronted with a spectrum which extends all the way from the nursery school, through the kindergarten, through the elementary school, through the secondary school, through the grammar school, through the university, through university research, through science, through technology, through development, through the Board of Trade and, finally, to the Treasury. It is inconceivable that any such immense mixture can be assimilated in one Ministry. The division had to be made somewhere. The division was made, perhaps arbitrarily, but it had to be made arbitrarily, and I think it is no worse than any place which has been suggested and is better than any other I can think of.
So, regrettable though it may be that we have had to split, I still think that the split has been made as sensibly as it could have been made, and I believe that it will work. It happens by coinci- dence that it is the very same place that the Russians have chosen to split their own Ministries. They have an Academy of Sciences and they have a Ministry of Technology which is quite separate from it, and they are as much aware as anyone else of the extreme importance, and the great difficulty, of maintaining adequate liaison between the pure and applied sciences.
There are one or two other points which I should like to make, my Lords, before answering the particular speeches that have been made. The first of them is that I would add mine to the many tributes which were paid in this House to the President of the Royal Society on his announcement of the proposed increase in the number of new Fellowships of the Royal Society, to be given to men who have made their name as applied scientists rather than as pure scientists. It is rather interesting that the Americans have found the same problem—it is extraordinary how international these problems are—in giving adequate repute and prestige to engineering these days. They themselves often said that when a rocket gets to the Moon it is a triumph of pure science, but when it fails it is a failure of engineering.
They, too, have attempted to solve the problem which our own Royal Society has been tackling, but they have done it in a slightly different way. They have set up a completely new Academy, an Academy of Engineers, to have the same sort of status as the Academy of Sciences has. Our own academy, if I may so describe the Royal Society, has chosen to enlarge its membership specifically to admit new applied 'scientists. The Royal Charter, with which King Charles II endowed it, required them to investigate the useful arts as well as the sciences.
I hope very much that this idea of the validity of pure and applied science will permeate the whole of society, including our universities. I also hope very much that our universities will associate themselves as closely as possible with local industry, through the industrial liaison officers of whom the noble Earl, Lord Bessborough, spoke, and through their own contacts. I hope very much, too, that English universities will be more liberal than they have been in the past, in permitting. and in fact encouraging, their staff to engage in consulting work for industry. Some universities have done extraordinarily well in this respect, and I think many firms have been very glad, and very generous, too, in the way in which they have welcomed academics to their fellowship, and have allowed them to play their proper part in the development of the industry, which, after all, is really the joint responsibility of the industry itself and of the academic world.
The noble Lord, Lord Todd, referred to the problem of the length of the course for engineers. My Lords, this is a matter which I think is often not properly appreciated. The real length of a course for a graduate engineer is usually six or seven years. He spends three years taking his first degree, then, very frequently, he takes a postgraduate apprenticeship—rather unfortunately so described—which may last for a couple of years; and thereafter he may have at least another year of practical experience—and all this before he becomes a properly chartered engineer. It is important, I think, not to lengthen the course too much. In Holland, it is now seven or eight years, and the Dutch find this very much strain.
In Harvard, not long ago, someone computed the average age of men who leave that University as Ph.Ds. They found that it has increased by an average of about three months a year ever since the war. On the same piece of paper the same statistician plotted the average age of retirement of executives who had been to Harvard, and found that this has dropped by about three years every year since 1950. If one extrapolates these two curves—and many a statistician has very confidently extrapolated far less reliable information than this—one finds that the two curves intersect in the year 1995. I am not sure what one can infer from this, and I cannot believe that the day will ever come when people will graduate from Harvard after they have retired.
One must remember that the business of life is living, and that the educational process should be kept to a minimum so that people can actually go out and do something, in order to make it possible to pay for these enormous universities which are costing us so much. A figure which I got when I was in the States last, which may interest your Lordships, is that it is estimated—heaven knows how!—that, of the total productivity of America, at this moment, about a half may be fairly attributed to the academic world. This is a remarkable statement to make; but not only is it true to say that firms will go and build new factories near to universities, but last year, in California, two firms went and built factories near where it was thought a campus was going to be put, in the confident expectation that the presence of the university would enormously increase their own potential productivity. Those of your Lordships who have ever been to Boston will know of the very large number of industries which have grown up on Route 128, which is a sort of by-pass around Boston, all of which depend on the presence of that very great complex in which I think there are now eleven universities and nearly two-thirds as many undergraduates as there are in the whole of Great Britain.
The importance of universities for the development of industry in America is now so notorious that it is beginning to be a matter of considerable political importance, and those States which have not as yet been fortunate enough to secure a large university within them are beginning to be very restive and to complain to the Federal Government that their own support of the centres of excellence now established is unfair, and they are trying to increase the number of large universities which can have the sort of Federal support which has made the great ones so famous. This, they believe to be important, not merely because of the value they attach to scholarship or to research but because of the immense commercial significance of a university as a centre from which new ideas and new projects can he expected to develop, quite as a matter of course and almost at once. It is this attitude of mind that, above all other things, it seems to me, we must import from America. As I said in this House a fortnight ago, it is far more important to import this than to import business schools. It was this very idea that the university is part of society, that it should study society's problems and should expect to solve them, to the immense benefit of society—an idea long understood in the American universities—which led, among many other things, to the creation of the business schools at an appropriate time.
My Lords, I should now like, very briefly, to pass to some of the points which have been made by noble Lords. I think I have already answered many of them, either directly or indirectly. First of all, the noble Lord, Lord Todd, raised the very general question as to why Germany and Japan are doing so much better than we are. It is remarkable, I think, that Japan has done relatively little pure research. On the other hand, they have always taken the problems of industrial research extremely seriously. For what it is worth, I think I might say that in 1895 the largest school of electrical engineering in which English was spoken was in Tokyo. They have always clearly understood the importance of applied science; and, again, one of the problems which we as a nation have to face is the extent to which we can afford to divert our resources into pure research.
I may say that, during the s, the s and the early part of this century, America did relatively little pure research but relied on Europe for original ideas which were then adapted for commercial use in America at small cost to them. We did the pure research which helped America to become great. I remember after the war talking to American scientists and asking them what they proposed to do as it would no longer be possible for them to depend on Europe for their pure research; and they said, quite simply, that they proposed to go to Europe and buy up all the best scientists they could find—and this they did. America's pre-eminence in research—and let us remind ourselves of this—has occurred only since the war. Until then, America depended entirely on Europe for its original ideas. It is significant that those countries which are increasing their gross national product most rapidly are those which are devoting almost all their efforts in applied research to adapting for production ideas originating elsewhere.
How far can we allow our best brains to be diverted into subjects whose immediate impact on the economy is not sufficiently obvious? This is going to be an extraordinarily difficult and agonising reappraisal, if I may use a phrase which has been used by other people in other places. Clearly, this must be, for the next several years, the major preoccupation of the Department which I have the honour to serve. There is no easy answer. One must not stop pure research. Obviously one must not; it would be impossible even to think of it. On the other hand, one must face the fact that other countries whose wealth is increasing very rapidly are doing much less than we are.
The noble Lord, Lord Todd, referred also to the possibility of using development contracts, and the noble Lords, Lord Snow and Lord Peddie, referred, too, to the same subject. If I may be forgiven. I should like to enlarge very briefly on the work which has been done in America to use the power of Government spending to develop new industrial ideas. The analysis of the defence spending which was made for Mr. McNamara very recently proved, to everyone's astonishment, that, among other things, although the Army bought few machine tools of its own, it was at one stage removed responsible for buying 1,000 million dollars worth every year. They are, therefore, profoundly convinced that the Army is capable of most profoundly influencing the whole machine-tool trade by requiring that those people who, on their behalf, spend 1,000 million dollars a year on machine tools, should do so in an attempt to improve the machine tools as well as just getting the guns and things made for which they were first bought.
McNamara was going to build, I think, nine new hospitals this year, and again he decided that, since this was an immense expenditure likely to have important repercussions on hospitals throughout the whole of the States, he would give two large contracts to universities to decide how best to design hospitals to the specification which the Army was prepared to write. This idea that it is possible to use the Government's purse in an attempt to influence commercial policy is one which is now exercising the Americans very much indeed, and, as the noble Lord, Lord Snow, has said, it is going to concern us, too.
The poor image of technology, and the fact that our 4 per cent. growth rate will not be possible unless we have more engineers, has been touched on by so many speakers that all I can say is that I am afraid it is only too true; and those of your Lordships who ever read the New Scientist will have seen a very significant discussion of the matter by Mr. Holloway, who is in charge of the appointments board in the University of Manchester, who Discusses, with appalling clarity, the almost certain shortfall in engineers and technologists by 1970. One of the more striking points he makes is that it is precisely in those subjects where the need is greatest that it is most difficult, to attract students. This can hardly b credited; but those departments for whose students the demand is not very great, are full, and those departments from which students are enormously in demand, are half-empty. This is one of the great mysteries and great tragedies of many universities, and it is one which particularly affected me when I was in Manchester. We had one or two departments—very unfamiliar ones, very important ones, yet almost wholly neglected by schoolboys.
THE EARL OF BESSBOROUGH May just ask the noble Lord whether he has any ideas as to how to deal with this problem? Because we recognise it to be so, of course.
LORD BOWDEN All I can say is that we did our best. We gave lectures to 23,000 schoolboys every year. We went round and saw headmasters; we had conferences with headmasters and careers masters; we wrote articles for all the magazines; and we sent circulars around. We did everything we could; but the situation, despite that, is as bad as I have told you—and it might have been worse if we had not done what we did. But it is extremely difficult. It is in some measure due, I am sure, to the fact that the schoolmasters, and the careers masters in particular, work in a fog. They do not know what departments there are. They have never heard of half of the industries that their students will go to. As the noble Lord, Lord Snow said, there is no simple, single solution. It involves the collaboration of everyone in a position to influence public opinion: industrialists, schoolmasters, headmasters, university professors, Government. The B.B.C. must also play their part if this extraordinarily vexatious problem is to be solved.
The noble Viscount, Lord Caldecote, referred to the importance of Government participation in buying computers, and particularly for developing software. This is well known to us and we are urgently studying what best is to be done. It is fair to say that the use of computers is even more important than their manufacture. We are worse at using them than we are at making them in England.
The importance of technicians was mentioned by several noble Lords, and obviously this is a matter of tremendous importance. I was interested to note Lord Peddie's remarks. Am I being mischievous if I infer from them that the best incentive for rapid automation in factories would be a very rapid rate of increase of wages? Whether "Neddy" will approve this as a suggestion is more than I can say.
The noble Earl, Lord Halsbury, pointed out the difficulty of distinguishing between research and development. This difficulty is well known. He and I collaborated once or twice in an attempt to circumvent his terms of reference, and our salvation came only because the Board of Trade, in writing them, followed the Napoleonic dictum that written constitutions should be short and obscure.
My Lords, if I have inadvertently omitted an answer to any of the questions posed by noble Lords, I will take refuge in the fact that I have already spoken for too long on matters immensely complex. I wish there were answers to half of the questions posed. I take comfort from the fact that on both sides of your Lordships' House there is an awareness of the difficulties of the task and of its importance and most important of all, there is the obvious eagerness of every Member of your Lordships' House who spoke today to help in what must inevitably be a joint and national enterprise. Once more I should like to express my thanks to the noble Lord, Lord Todd, for introducing this subject to us this afternoon.

LORD TODD My Lords, we have had an excellent summing-up to this debate, which I found extremely interesting, by the noble Lord, Lord Bowden. It has been a great pleasure to find that not only I but all noble Lords who spoke are very much in agreement about this enormous problem, and all of us will, I am sure, wish to see everything possible done to put things right. We may, of course, have little points of difference here and there. For instance, in his summing up, the noble Lord, Lord Bowden, made reference to my comments about training courses for engineers. I realise that in this country it does, in fact, take six years, if you look at it the way he looks at it. The point that I was raising was whether the particular type of courses we have, three years in the university and then a graduate apprenticeship and what-not, is the best possible arrangement. Should we not have more post-graduate courses in universities rather than relying simply on experience in industry?
LORD BOWDEN My Lords, I strongly agree about this. I was referring simply to the total time.
LORD TODD My Lords, I realise this. I think that perhaps a little more pure research is being done in Germany and Japan than the noble Lord gives credit for. They do quite a considerable amount of pure research in some fields, in both countries.
I think the debate has been well summed up, but I should like to make one point. There has been a certain amount of talk on this question of where science and technology should be divided up. It is clear that neither I nor any other noble Lord who spoke would think that a vast omnibus Ministry, with the whole of education, science and technology, would work. We may have slight differences about the precise point of division; but I hope the noble Lord, Lord Snow, did not think that I. or, indeed, other members of the Trend Committee, had suggested that the whole gamut of education, science and technology should be in one Ministry.
LORD SNOW Oh, no!
LORD TODD I must say that I was greatly struck by one part of Lord Snow's remarks, when he was telling us about what the Minister of Technology is doing. He told us that the Minister was listening carefully before taking any action. This seems to be a new and revolutionary concept in Government and one which might with great profit be extended to other Departments. As I have said, we have had an extremely interesting debate to-day, and I should like to say how grateful I am personally to all noble Lords who have taken part. With that I beg leave to withdraw my Motion.
LORD GREENHILL rose to call attention to the present state of adult education; and to move for Papers. The noble Lord said: My Lords, I think that we all agree that it is appropriate that a subject of this kind should be discussed in your Lordships' House, because there are so many noble Lords who have been outstanding in the furthering of adult education. If I do not mention them all (although I know who they are) I should like, with your Lordships' permission, to mention just two, unfortunately no longer with us, whose names have stood—throughout the world, indeed—for the furthering of adult education.
One was the late Lord Lindsay of Birker, and the other was the late Archbishop Temple, of this House. Having in my own long connection with adult education known them both, perhaps I may be allowed to add that Lord Lindsay of Birker, when he was Professor of Moral Philosophy and Logic at Glasgow University, was the author and the begetter of the first extra-mural committee that Glasgow University set up. He was a member of the Workers'
744
Educational Association, and, combing through some old newspaper reports, one reads that when a certain county in Scotland felt itself unable to pay the cost of a tutor to lecture to an adult education class, he, the late Lord Lindsay of Birker, himself went and did the lecturing without any pay at all. In the case of Archbishop Temple, I was present at the st birthday celebrations in Oxford at which he presided. Beside him then was the founder of the W.E.A., Albert Mansbridge, by that time, unfortunately, an old and ailing man; and to see that great audience moved by what Archbishop Temple had to say to them, and the support he received, would do anyone's heart good if it could be seen again to-day.
Nor must I forget some Members of your Lordships' House present to-day who have also done a great deal of work on behalf of the adult education movement. I would first mention our noble Leader, Lord Longford, for not only was he himself a tutor of adult classes but his wife (although not then his wife) was also a tutor at adult education classes. I believe I am right in saying that they married, happily as we know, when each of them had worked as a tutor in adult education. Then (although I have not asked his permission), I feel that it would be a serious omission if I did not refer to the long years of work that the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, did in the promotion of adult education. Since your Lordships have heard me refer to the W.E.A., an organisation well known in the field of adult education, let me add that for some years Mr. R. A. Butler has been an honorary vice-president, as also was the late and deeply lamented Hugh Gaitskell, and as is to-day our present Prime Minister, Harold Wilson. So that there is a most respectable and influential background of persons behind this movement.
If your Lordships were to ask what prompts me to raise this matter to-day I would give one or two reasons. There is, as your Lordships know, a long history attaching to this, part of which I shall refer to. There is a real upsurge to-day in the demand for adult education: it is greater than it has been for some time, and we are hoping that, certainly under the present Government, there will be no kind of hesitation in satisfying the modest demands that are being made for still further development in the field of adult education. I should perhaps also tell your Lordships that while for many years I have admired the tremendous amount and excellent quality of the work of the lady whom I knew as "Barbara Wootton", it is only since her elevation to your Lordships' House that it has been my privilege to meet her in person.
I have with me a large amount of literature with which I do not intend to bore your Lordships, but I think that some of the titles are worth mentioning for they give some idea of the enormous width of the field which is covered by present-day adult education. When I first came into contact with the movement, now almost half a century ago, it was a very different kind of audience with which we dealt compared with the audience we meet to-day. They were people who were anxious to become acquainted with developments in education, mainly for economic reasons, or because they were unable to take advantage of such educational facilities as there were in those days in the primary schools. Few of them ever aspired to reaching the secondary school, but there was this craving for further knowledge which they wished to have satisfied, and which they could satisfy only through the classes of that kind provided by the W.E.A.
Today it is very different. Again, I repeat that I do not want to go through the whole history of this, but one or two pointers in this development are perhaps not without interest today. There is, for example, in Glasgow, a college—which was at one time a technical college—which men would attend in the evening for lessons and further knowledge in the technologies in which they were engaged. In time the numbers so grew that difficulty was experienced in coping with them. Today that old College, which was known as Anderson College, is now the University of Strathclyde, the second University in Glasgow, of which a Member of your Lordships' House, the noble Lord, Lord Todd, is Chancellor, who is himself a Glasgow-born man and who received his secondary education in Glasgow. That is one development of what began as this move- ment for further education of the uneducated people of our country. believe that we were the first in the world to promote adult education, and I sometimes wonder whether there is another legislative assembly anywhere, even today, which would think it worth while to devote the greater part of an afternoon to discussing problems of this kind.
What is occupying our minds very much indeed today is that, in spite of the advances in publicly-provided education which our young men and women are receiving, there is a still greater demand for advanced education, technical, cultural, non-vocational education, which we cannot supply. There are nowadays residential colleges—one or two in England, only one so far in Scotland—to which go young men and women, who are perhaps rather raw in their background education but who within a very short time do remarkable things in the further education which they seek. I do not wish to mention, and I have not asked permission to do so, the names of any colleagues of my own, but after my noble friend Lord Lawson married he threw up his job as a coal miner for two or three years and went to Ruskin College, Oxford. After he had spent some years there he was asked what he was going to do at the completion of his preliminary period. His answer, as one would expect from him, was that he meant to return to his home and to work. That was all he wanted to do. He wanted the education. but he did not want it to take him out of the class to which he felt he belonged.
Indeed, I was impressed when a few days ago I came across a book on the non-adult education topic of Language Teaching in the New Education, in which the writer in the early part of his book—and I support him—says: We can no longer be content with the philosophy of a minority culture. If there is a culture to be enjoyed, that culture should be enjoyed by every class in the community capable of appreciating that culture. No longer should there be any kind of distinction. I am not advocating anything particularly new. I am simply trying to arouse your Lordships' interest in still further developments of a movement in which we have already seen such great progress.
747
I should like to give one or two examples from my own personal experience. I happen to be interested in the Scottish Residential College for Adults, known as Newbattle Abbey College. This College was given to us by the late Lord Lothian (not the present one) as a residential College for adult students. We have carried on that work, with a gap during the war since 1937. As one of the tutors in philosophy we had a young man who was born in Clydebank, near Glasgow, whose father worked as a shipyard worker in the yards of John Brown, and whose brother may, I believe, still be in the yards of John Brown in the joinery department. That young man, having shown some ability at school, ultimately found himself at Oxford, where he graduated with a very good degree. After a time he came up to us at Newbattle Abbey College as a tutor.
To speak to him, to look at him, to listen to him, one would never think that he was a product of a family of the once despised working class. He was a typical Oxford graduate, and stayed with us as a tutor in philosophy for nine years. Then the ambitious new University of Strathclyde thought that for their liberal studies they would like a lecturer in philosophy, so they induced away this young man, who had been with us all those years, and our College was in the position of having to find someone else. We did the usual advertising, the usual examining, and cut down our "short-leet" (as we call it in Scotland: that is to say, our short list) to two, one a young man, the other a young woman.
I hope that I do not identify the lady when I say that she seemed to me to be a typical Lancashire mill girl in appearance, dress and manner. She had, in fact, worked as a mill girl in Lancashire, and had attended tutorial classes for three years, at the end of which she attained an honours M.A. degree. Then, presumably finding that an easy thing to do, she thought she would carry on for another two years, and eventually left Manchester University with a Ph.D. degree. We decided that we should give her the appointment, but she explained that she had applied for another appointment and if by chance she got the other appoint- ment she would prefer it. That was because in addition to her tutorial work she would also have the supervision of some of the female students there, and that was the kind of work she wished to add to her ordinary tutorial work. She got the job, and so we were left with applicant No. 2.
Applicant No. 2 was, and is, a young man who had come to Newbattle Abbey College at the age of just over 18, having left what in Scotland is called the junior secondary school at, I think, the age of 16. He had done all sorts of little jobs such as working in a garage and, I think, in a butchery shop, or something of that kind. He had then decided that he would prefer to go back to learning something, and found himself, with the aid of a bursary from Edinburgh Education Committee, at Newbattle Abbey College. He stayed there for a year or more until he obtained his entrance qualifications to Edinburgh University where he obtained his degree, and from there he went to the London School of Economics, where there was no job waiting for him, but he was given some kind of research work to do, which he did.
He applied for the post, as I said, and we told him, "We will take you, No. 2." So to-day our tutor in philosophy is a youngish man still, who might still have been a garage worker if he wished to be. But he is also one of those men who had the brains to pursue an educational course, and from that to become a tutor in philosophy. This is one of a number of examples within my own knowledge which I could give your Lordships in order to show the kind of product one can make by this process of adult education, when one gets people with the necessary desire to make progress.
Therefore, when I speak to your Lordships to-day—and although I have with me an enormous amount of literature it is only a very small part of the total literature available on adult education—I should like you to know the kinds of ends at which we are aiming in order to arouse a still greater interest among the adult population in the subjects that we teach. For example, I have here the current Newbattle Abbey prospectus. What one does not learn from the prospectus itself is the extraordinary increase there has been in demand within the last few years; so much so, that although the building is packed beyond the normal complement of students, nevertheless they continue to come. Therefore to-day we are asking for an extension to Newbattle Abbey to accommodate 80 students in what are called nowadays "study bedrooms", in order to cope with this demand. I am pleased to inform your Lordships that the chairman of the appeal committee to raise the money necessary for this extension is the present Marquess of Lothian, who was until recently a Junior Minister in the previous Government.
I have here a book entitled Science and Labour, writter as long ago as 1924, edited by Mr. Humberstone and Lord Askwith, K.C.B., K.C., gives a foreword to it. These are the names and the standings of some of the men then interested: Sir Richard Gregory, Sir Richard Glaze-brook, the Right Honourable Lord Askwith, Hugo Hirst, Sir Oliver Lodge, C. T. Cramp—a member of the Trades Union Congress—the Right Honourable Lord Ashfield, Miss Margaret Bondfield, M.P., Sir Arthur Newsholme, M.D., K.C.B.—who was, I think, in the Public Health Department—Arthur Greenwood, M.P., and R.

Among many publications, there were books of permanent value which showed the interest at that time. There was the 1919 Committee under the Ministry of Reconstruction, headed by the then Master of Balliol, who did a thorough survey of the demands of adult education. They reported enthusiastically about the needs and the value of adult education, and were instrumental in the setting up by the Board of Education, as it was then called, of an Adult Education Committee which published booklets such as the one I have here, which is called The Scope and Practice of Adult Education. But, for some reason or other, that Committee has ceased to exist as a body specialising in adult education.
Nuffield College published in 1940 The Further Education of Men and Women. The American organisation, the Fund for Adult Education, has thought it worth while to publish a look by Guy Hunter which is called Some New Developments in British Adult Education. I do not know whether any of your Lordships know Guy Hunter, but he has recently completed a book on adult education in Africa, in some of the new Commonwealth countries. your Lordships will permit me, I will read out the titles of some other publications. There is The W.E.A. and the Early School Leaver, published in 1964; the Workers' Educational Association, Minutes of the National Conference of 1962; Science and Society, a W.E.A. discussion paper; Reflections on the Robbins Report, and The Challenge of Newsom by a Working Party of the Association of Head Mistresses. These publications are not merely praising the work of Robbins and of Newsom, but are critically examining and giving their impressions of it. Then there is Education For a Changing Society: The Rôle of W.E.A. I think I am right in saying that this book, which is as up to date as it can be, is the outcome of the inspiration of Professor Asa Briggs, the present President of the W.E.A., and a professor at one of the southern universities.
There is Higher Education, in which the previous Government approved the contents of the Robbins Report, but so far as I am aware they did not do very much to implement it. I can say, in passing, that the Robbins Report, going outside of the limit of its remit, gave favourable support to the encouragement of adult education and to its results. The Organisation and Finance of Adult Education was a report by Dr. Eric Ashby, as he then was, following upon some complaints that the adult education movement had in connection with what the Government of the time were doing; but it is interesting to me, partly because the author of this Report, assisted by a number of other people, is Ashby, and partly because the Report contains, in reply to a letter from Sir Vincent Tewson (who was then, I think, Secretary of the Trades Union Congress), a letter by Winston Churchill enthusiastically supporting the aims and purposes of adult education, and giving us every encouragement to proceed with our work.
Then, in 1944 the Nuffield College produced a statement, Problems of Scientific and Industrial Research. Further, there are documents here entitled, Who were the Students?; Entrance to Universities—which is by the W.E.A.; Expenditure on Education, also by the W.E.A.; and, very recently indeed, in the last few days, a Report on Adult Education in Northern Ireland by a Committee under the chairmanship of Principal Morris, of Leeds University, in which they speak glowingly of the value and importance of adult education. For those who are willing to read it—I do not want to weary Members—there are references to the position in Scotland and to the position in England of extramural departments and the like, which carry out and recommend the sort of thing we have been doing for some years.
My Lords, if I may, I should like to read, even in her absence, what was written by Lady Wootton of Abinger (as perhaps I should now call her) in March, 1940, at a time when we were all disturbed about the outcome of the war. This is the sort of thing that, with her typically incisive language, she was saying: We have, I think, to recognise a broad distinction here between the job of the politician or man of affairs, and the job of the student. This distinction is additional to, though it is closely connected with, the obvious difference that the politician is obliged to get things done, while the student works under no such pressure. It is a distinction which holds in the field in which both politician and student are"— this is typically Barbara Wootton— (we hope!) thinkers. It has to do with the span of their thought, using that word to cover both the actual time-scale upon which they work, and the range of possibilities which they can take into account. The student is a long-term, long-range, the politician a short-term, short-range, thinker". That may be taken as a compliment or otherwise, as your Lordships feel applies.
I should like next to draw your Lordships' attention to a document issued by the Universities Council for Adult Education and the Workers' Educational Association under the heading, Crisis in Adult Education. Again, my Lords, I do not intend to read the whole of it; I will just read the final part, which says this: It is the contention of the Responsible Bodies, first, that adult education is not merely desirable but an inescapable necessity for a democratic society; secondly, that the present level of provision is ludicrously low; and thirdly, that a vast improvement in provision could be achieved by a very modest, indeed almost insignificant, increase in expenditure. They ask that as the first step towards more adequate provision the present ill-judged and short-sighted attempt at economy will at once be abandoned". There, my Lords, you have the gist of the present trend. I think it would perhaps help to add to the importance of this subject if I were to draw your Lordships' attention to the Report of the Director-General of the International Labour Organisation, Part I of which deals with "Automation and other Technological Developments and Labour and Social Implications". I will read only one paragraph of the chapter headed "More education and training for adults". It reads as follows: Socially and psychologically perhaps the most important impact of an accelerated rate of technological change is on the situation of adult workers. Changes in the occupational and skill structure tend to upset existing social stratifications and relationships in industry and to create a number of problems which, if not properly solved, may lead to personal misfortunes and to serious industrial unrest. This Report, I need hardly say, is from an impartial body concerned with the wellbeing of workers of the world as a whole.
My Lords, I have perhaps trespassed on your time a little too long, but I should like to say this: we are not criticising the past Government, and certainly not the present Government; and we are not raising any controversial issue. We have no reason to think that there is anyone with any social conscience who is prepared to doubt the value and the importance of adult education. We have ample evidence that there is increasingly a demand by adults for work in these classes—we do not ask them—not for vocational reasons, and not for any other reason than a sheer desire to know more and more of the rapid changes in technological, scientific and other developments that are taking place before our eyes, and at a pace with which we can hardly cope, because no sooner do we adapt ourselves to one state of affairs than another one is on the way.
We know that steps are being taken by all kinds of parties all over the world in order to meet this particular problem with which we are faced, and for that reason I have so far made no reference to the developments taking place in radio and in television, by both the B.B.C. and the independent bodies. I have not spoken about the development in programme learning, which we hope will be more and more used as an aid to acquiring an education; and I have not tried to draw a distinction between what might be called the Robbins type of higher education individual and the Newsom type (or, as we say in Scotland, also, the Brunton type) of student, both of whom have their own needs to be catered for.
All that I ask your Lordships to do is to recognise these things: first of all, that it is not extravagant to spend more money upon the development of this kind of adult education; that it is absolutely necessary that some kind of additional accommodation be provided, either by the State or by local education authorities, either alone or in conjunction with other parties, in order to make it possible to have residential colleges as part and parcel of our normal provision of adult education; that, in so far as there are university entrance conditions to be overcome, they should not be conditions which are suitable mainly for the boy or girl who has just passed through secondary school and is trying to get through into university; but that any adult student who shows any kind of ability at all should be given an entrance into the university, as I understand the university of Strathclyde is willing to do to-day. These are the things which, through no revolutionary change in our procedures, through no kind of drastic amendment of our existing laws, can be done, to the immense benefit of the community as a whole; because basically what we are doing here is simply to encourage the growth of a movement which both on economical grounds and, mainly, on social grounds can do nothing but bring good and prosperity to our country. My Lords, I beg to move for Papers.

LORD HILL OF LUTON My Lords, I know your Lordships will extend your usual generosity to one who addresses your Lordship's Home for the first time, in the debate for the initiation of which we are greatly indebted to the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill. To many of your Lordships, as they do to me, the words "adult education" arouse nostalgic memories of the earlier days of the adult education movement, so strongly inspired, as the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill, made clear to-day, by a strong sense of social purpose. My own recollections go back to the days when, fresh from university, I took W.E.A. and university tutorial classes in biology for some five years, mostly at that famous institution then known as The Morley College for Working Men and Women. Indeed, I remember the apprehension I felt at the periodic visits to my classes of that most remarkable woman, the then Director of Studies of the London University Tutorial Organisation and now the noble Baroness, Lady Wootton of Abinger. I think she will forgive me if I say in her absence that I was somewhat scared of her in those days—a condition from which I have nearly recovered.
But, my Lords, broadly speaking, the adult education movement of those days, still under the inspiring leadership of Albert Mansbridge, sought to bring education to those who were trying to make up for missed educational opportunities. The formal education of most of the students of my classes had ended at the age of 14, and in some cases at the age of 13; and one swiftly realised the powerful curiosity and capacity of many of the students, and their sensitive nose for the ill-prepared lecture or the woolly generalisation, their distrust of the ex cathedrâ pronouncement or any signs of intellectual superiority, and the great importance in that work (though this may seem a detail) of that most difficult of all exercises, the written essay—a fact of importance when we come to consider the hearing of modern methods of mass communication upon this subject.
No doubt there are many among the 2 million-odd who each year attend local authority evening classes, university extramural and W.E.A. classes to-day who are trying to make up for their lack of educational opportunity; but there is another group of growing size. An increasing proportion of our mature students go in for some form of non-vocational adult education to-day because the education that they have had arouses the appetite for more. In short, one of the tasks to-day is to satisfy the greater demand, the upsurge of demand, as the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill, called it, that educational policies of the last twenty years have helped to create.
Of course, social efficiency, in the sense of productivity, comes into the argument. The annual rate of growth of knowledge is certainly in excess of the much-disputed 4 per cent. Indeed, such is the growth, that nowadays no man can claim his professional education was completed with the last qualification he took. There, of course, lies the case for refresher courses for professionals in a wide variety of fields, to say nothing of instruction in management, which your Lordships were discussing last week, in retraining, and a host of other applications to industry as well as to the professions.
Then again, my Lords, there is the increased demand for educational opportunities for married women. With the fall in the age of marriage and the tendency to have the family at an earlier age, we are seing quite a new pattern. Whereas at the beginning of this century when a mother had finished bringing up her much larger family she was much older, and there was little time and energy left for developing new interests or reawakening old interests, nowadays this phase lasts very much longer and mothers no longer give up the intellectual ghost. This lies behind the new pattern of women in employment. Forty years ago one-tenth of married women went to work; now it is one-third. But so much for the demand, the greatly increased demand.
No one can ignore the effect or importance of mass communication including television, if I may be forgiven for saying a word on this subject, speaking only for myself. By its means, by means of radio, and in particular of television, more than ever people are being made aware of the variety and change in the world of to-day. As one of Her Majesty's Ministers, Miss Jennie Lee, puts it in the current issue of T.V. Times: Television has made millions of people more aware of what is going on in the world than they have ever been before. This is one effect of television, and a most important one. Another is obviously to divert. Diversion, indeed, is what most people demand first and foremost from television. And who is to say that diversion is not a proper rôle for television? However, what is less clear is its ability to educate. As Cardinal Newman put it, We must carefully distinguish between the mere diversion of the mind and its real education. Indeed, let it be said that the awakened sense of awareness aroused by radio and television may even give rise to bewilderment. We need to recognise, I suggest, this limitation of present-day radio and television in a modern community. They blaze a trail which they cannot easily follow. Incidentally, one should empha- sise the tremendous value of television in combating illiteracy, for it has the power visually to stimulate and inform in advance of literacy. But, by and large, modern mass communications, while they may increase the interest and wonder and titillate the imagination, are not adult education in the sense in which the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill, introduced the subject, or indeed, in the normal use of the words, though they may be a preparation for it.
Over and above the arousing of interest, there is, I believe, a need of formal disciplined programmes planned in series and designed to contribute to the progressive mastery of some skill or body of knowledge to quote the words which govern these adult educational programmes on television. But this, I believe, is the nub of the matter. Can television through these adult education programmes provide the whole of what is needed?
Of course, a good deal is being done by the B.B.C. and the I.T.A. to-day—for example, language programmes, Physics for Teachers, the Science of Man, a series on the law, Towards 2000, and one which interests me particularly, the medical postgraduate refresher course first put out in Glasgow. And, if I may say so, well worth the mention, though not strictly adult education in the sense of this debate, are those superbly given talks by Dr. A. J. P. Taylor. There have been experiments, too, in co-operation with the local education authorities and the responsible bodies, such as the course in English Literature, put out in I.T.V's Southern area, and the Economics course, in the Midland area, linked with a correspondence course and designed by the Extra-Mural Department of Nottingham University.
It is on this point that I want to rest for a moment. I believe that this is of the greatest interest and importance. This is an exciting attempt to bring to television teaching that form of participation by the student which is involved in written work, including the essay. Many noble Lords will recall the days when we knew from experience it was only when notes were taken at a lecture, whatever the fate of those notes thereafter, that there was a reasonable chance of a proportion of the pearls cast at us really hitting the mark. This kind of experiment, of television plus student participation has not been done before on any large scale.
I know that it is tempting to think that, because the transmitting apparatus is available, because a channel can be found, because the television screen can be, as it were, a blackboard in millions of homes, all that is necessary is to find a first-class teacher and the best visual material—do that and the problem is solved. But it is not so simple as that. Television, yes, is a great awakener, a stimulator of new interest. It can be invaluable where there is a desire for instruction already present, as for refresher courses. It can bring more specialism to the specialist. It can stimulate those whose educational interests are slight or dormant. It can evoke in us interests which we just did not know we could cultivate. It can be a prodder, a galvaniser a stimulator. It can provide, too, the routine, factually informative lecture by the best available expert. But I submit that other means are needed to provide the judgment and independent thought about the facts, as. for example, in the tutorial seminar or discussion group.
For this purpose, I believe that we need television-plus. Can television organise these other means? Can the "plus" be added? This is the test. I believe and hope that the Nottingham experiment will help to supply an answer. But the incontrovertible point I put to your Lordships is that those who want adult education in the strictest sense, in the sense in which the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill, has opened this debate, must undergo a disciplined study under the guidance of a competent teacher. Television can play a part in providing this disciplined study only if other links can be created between the teacher and the taught. This can never be easy, but it is well worth trying—trying to take the fullest advantage of an immensely powerful medium of mass communication without ever forgetting that the personality and the power of the teacher are essential and the need for a relationship between the teacher and the taught.

BARONESS ELLIOT OF HARWOOD My Lords, it seems almost superfluous to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Hill of Luton, who has just sat down, on his maiden speech. I can remember when once, if not twice, a week his voice was familiar to all of us as that of the Radio Doctor; and I also recall, as I am sure all noble Lords do, his long service in another place and the many speeches he made there and outside. But it is customary to congratulate noble Lords the first time they speak in this House, and I do so on behalf of your Lordships with very great pleasure.
It is very interesting for all of us to hear from him, because of his new and important position as Chairman of the Independent Television Authority, the kind of approach that the Authority are taking towards adult education. I was fascinated by what he had to say, and I hope that the programme he has outlined and the work which I.T.A. are planning to do in adult education will be immensely successful. I hope that from time to time we shall hear from the noble Lord how this approach to adult education on television is progressing. I am sure that we shall all listen, when opportunity offers, to these programmes. Again I congratulate the noble Lord on the great interest of his maiden speech.
I am always interested in listening to the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill, who is an expert on this subject and has spent much of his life in helping adult education. To-day, in his long and interesting account of the historical background to adult education, no one could have given us more information. The only thing I would add, although perhaps it is unnecessary, is a word about the enormous amount of help given to adult education in Scotland, not only by the Government, because that goes without saying, but also by the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust, which, for example, gave a large sum of money to start Newbattle College and which always supports adult education in a generous manner. I am glad that the money spent has borne much fruit and that the work done at Newbattle is still a useful and important part of adult education in Scotland.
I apologise to your Lordships for speaking so soon after the long speech which I made on the subject of the Consumer Council's Report. I intervene to-day because I am anxious to introduce into the programme of adult education, as one of its important matters, the subject of consumer education or consumer enlightenment. If I may, I would say a few words on this. The approach to the consumer through adult education is important. What both noble Lords, Lord Greenhill and Lord Hill of Luton, have said enter into the picture. Lord Hill of Luton has spoken particularly of the encouragement of classes for adult education in the new media.
On June 9, your Lordships had a debate on the Council of Industrial Design and another, the week before last, on the Consumer Council. In both these debates, we discussed the question of choice—the choice of design and the choice of quality. I think that the problem of choice and of informing the consumer, so that the consumer can choose wisely and appreciate the best standards and designs, are matters which come into education of the consumer.
Our conception of adult education has in the past perhaps been rather chained to the traditional lines or the traditional subjects. Now I should like to suggest to the adult education organisations that they should approach it from a rather more modern point of view or, at any rate, introduce some modern ideas into the various classes which are provided. I should like the people who are interested in this subject to study the most interesting pamphlet on consumer education which came out recently, published by the Research Institute for Consumer Affairs. There is in this pamphlet an excellent chapter which shows that there are exciting possibilities for a fusion of adult education and consumer education. It shows how, starting from everyday issues arising from quite practical considerations, adult education and consumer education can play a part in creating the informed, self-respecting, concerned persons whose influence can be so great on the mind of the society we live in.
Here I should like to pay a tribute to the work done by some of the well-known colleges of adult education, and by the Co-operative Movement, in their college at Loughborough, at which I was privileged to speak quite recently. All these places have done a great deal of work on consumer education in their adult education groups. Organisations like the women's institutes and the townswomen's guilds, and quite a number of other women's organisations, have now developed a considerable interest in providing a type of class or discussion group concerned with consumer affairs. I very much hope that local education authorities, in so far as they are introducing into their classes new subjects, will also consider more of these subjects.
Not long ago I addressed a conference of heads of commercial colleges and technical institutes, and I was most interested in what they told me about the kind of class they were organising: non-vocational classes, and classes of a technical character, too. The thing that struck me, in conversation with the heads of these institutes, was that they were, on the whole, trying to lay on what I call a course of six, eight or ten lectures on a subject to do with consumer education, and they were rather surprised when they found that many of the students could not stay the course. I urged them not to make of this subject something in the nature of six, eight, ten or twelve consecutive lectures, but to make a more imaginative approach to the subject which would be interesting because of the variety of different subjects covered.
I was most interested to find in the National Institute of Adult Education publication, which I am sure the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill, knows well, an account of the kind of adult education of which I am thinking, and which could be applied to many other subjects. I should like to refer to one example given: it is a course which took place in Birmingham on house purchase for adults, pointing out that such a course would be valuable if it did no more than give practical information about buying houses. But such a course could in fact go on to consider other issues. How well do estate agents do their jobs? Is estate agency an efficient system for bringing together people who want somewhere to live and people with houses to sell or let? Should houses be a marketable commodity? How can the housing shortage be overcome? Has any other country ever solved its housing problem? I can think of a number of subjects which could be used in that way in adult education classes and in adult education establishments. But one would need to think of the subjects that affect people in their everyday lives and translate them into courses—perhaps "courses" is the wrong word, since I am net thinking in terms of long courses on a particular subject, but of simple courses on subjects which interest consumers. This is a matter which I should like to see brought into the adult education field. I think the television authorities, if I may say so to the noble Lord, Lord Hill of Luton, could well help in this way, since the type of subject I am thinking about is one which would greatly interest viewers.
The number of people who attend adult education classes is quite large, and much larger than I thought until I read some of the information with which I was supplied before this debate. There are one million men and women who take non-vocational courses in evening institutes and technical colleges to-day; and the majority of these are women. Therefore, I think there is an opportunity for those who are devising lectures and courses to bring out the consumer emphasis.
Many of your Lordships may be, and no doubt are, listening to the current series of Reith Lectures which are being given by Sir Leon Eagrit, and are absolutely fascinating. In the last lecture, on Sunday evening, this great expert on automation spoke quite simply about the effects that automation is going to have on our society. stressing the enormous need there will be for the increase in support of every subject—I was going to say other than automation. He stressed that the time people will have at their disposal in an automated society will be so great that all the liberal arts that we are interested in and want to support—music, literature, discussion, the development of museums, libraries and so on—are going to be far more important in future than they are to-day. He was urging us (and this is the man who is talking all the time about the new automated society) to spend more and more money, and give more and more support to the liberal artistic education in and through what I think I can call the category of adult education.
I therefore feel that the need for adult education in our technical and social environment to-day even more important than it was in the past. As the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill, has pointed out, in the past adult education was largely a supplement to the education of people who had not the opportunity that is available to-day of staying at school and going to universities. But to-day we have this other problem to face—I do not even like to call it a problem, because, although it is sometimes so considered, I hope it will be something of enormous pleasure and benefit: I refer to the best way we can use our leisure and employ the hours we are given by the inventions of the th century. Following on those inventions, I think this question of adult education, training people to use their leisure to the best advantage, is of enormous importance.
So I would suggest to those noble Lords who are interested in adult education, and in education generally, that there is a need in this field for an approach to what I have called a consumer education, or consumer enlightenment—something which would be of great advantage, not only to those who are taking the classes and the courses, but also to those who are giving them, since we shall have a much more enlightened public which will help the manufacturers and the producers and the services which are provided for the public, by making people more discriminating in the way they use these services. We need the opportunity to learn new skills, to think new thoughts, and to discover new horizons if we are to make our contribution as consumers and to make wise decisions. Consumer education is only a part of adult education, but I believe it to be an important part. I should like to emphasise that this is a new approach to this subject, or rather a new subject with an old approach, and to urge it upon those people who are concerned with, and interested in, education.
I cannot help quoting, at the end of my speech, the last paragraph of a letter which appears in this interesting, but now rather old, Report on the Organisation and Finance of Adult Education—a Report made to my noble friend Lady Horsbrugh, who was Minister of Education at the time, and which contains this remarkable letter from Sir Winston Churchill. In the last paragraph of his letter to Sir Vincent Tewson of the Trades Union Congress, he says: I have no doubt myself that a man or woman earnestly seeking in grown-up life to be guided to wide and suggestive knowledge in its largest and most uplifted sphere will make the best of all the pupils in this age of clatter and buzz, of gape and gloat. The appetite of adults to be shown the foundations and processes of thought will never he denied by a British Administration cherishing the continuity of our Island life; I recommend those words to the members of the Government—that we all of us cherish the continuity of our Island life, and I hope that adult education is one of the subjects which will continue and flourish under whatever Government governs this country.

LORD CHORLEY My Lords, I hope the noble Lady who has just resumed her seat will forgive me if I do not follow her in the very interesting discussion which she has given us on education in the consumer movement—not that I do not entirely agree that it is very important and that obviously much attention should be given to it. I have been a member of the Consumers' Association since it started, although not the noble Lady's organisation. Its founder was a student of mine at the London School of Economics and one of my students of whom I am most proud, Mr. Michael Young. The noble Lady will realise that if I do not follow her, it is not because I do not think that what she was saying was important.
The whole subject, of course, is one of great importance, and I should like to add my tribute to the noble Lady's on the maiden speech of the noble Lord who sits on the Cross Benches. It was an enlightened and progressive speech—I can understand why he sat on the Cross Benches—with much thought in it, and with almost all of which I agree. To some of the things he said I hope to come back at a later stage in my speech. So far as the speaking goes, up to now I think it might almost be said that this was a debate among ex-teachers in Colleges of Adult Education. We all seem to have been mixed up in it to a greater or lesser extent, and I plead guilty to having been mixed up in it, perhaps to a rather less extent than some others but still to some extent. It has outside and generally in Parliament been too much assumed that education is a discipline for young people and something, so to speak, to be got through; and that when it has been got through it lasts you the rest of your life and there is not very much need for anything further, at any rate in the nature of disciplined education.
I dare say that in the past there was a good deal of truth in that. In stable societies, in which very little change took place and there was very little progress, that may well have been so; but it is emphatically no longer true in the sort of society which now exists throughout the civilized world—the modern, dynamic sort of society in which change is going on the whole time. A great deal of that change is fundamental in character. The world has changed more during the years since many of us in this Chamber were schoolboys than it changed in the whole of the previous 2,000 years. The education which we received in the early years of the present century no longer enables us to understand in any real sense of the term a great deal of the scientific and other basic work on which modern society, not only on its economic and business side but on a great deal of its cultural side, now depends. Therefore, it is very important that all of us, and not only the people who have been only to elementary schools until they were 14 or 15, should not only have the advantage of adult education but, in effect, in one way or another, be induced or even driven into it, because we really need it enormously.
Society now is altogether different from what it was, and it has been well said that no man will die in the society into which he was born". In spite of this, it remains true, I think, generally speaking, in Parliament and outside, that all the emphasis of recent years has been on training and education for youth. You can read through the Crowther Report from end to end, you can read through the Newsom Report from end to end, and you can read through the Albemarle Report from end to end, and you will not find much about adult education. You can read through the Robbins Report. In that Report, as Sir Ben Bowen Thomas said in his stimulating recent address to the Adult Education Institute, there are "two pages of kind words", and a reference to an Appendix to be produced, in which there are three or four pages of rather colourless statistics which do not carry us very much further.
I should like to take this opportunity of paying a tribute to the work of Sir Ben Bowen Thomas. Many of the great leaders in the adult education world have been justly praised this afternoon. Sir Ben, over the years since the end of the war, has been a great force in adult education. Anybody who knows what is going on in the adult education world must realise that he has perhaps been the greatest force. As adviser to the Ministry of Education he has been a most stimulating influence there. The Ministry of Education has not been as forthcoming as I think it should have been in regard to the recognition and encouragement of adult education. It is a naturally conservative institution, and it has approached this problem on rather conventional lines. Sir Ben Bowen Thomas has succeeded—and, his success has perhaps become evident during the last two or three years—in instilling a great deal more interest and activity in that institution than it previously had.
As my noble friend Lord Greenhill has said—and I should like to thank him very much for giving us the opportunity this afternoon of discussing this subject—we have in this country a creditable history in the way of adult education. I think he was perhaps a little too adulatory of this, because I believe adult education started in Denmark rather than in this country. On the agricultural side, the work of Grundvig and others, which goes back to quite early years in the last century, undoubtedly has been the basis of the astonishing prosperity of Denmark as an agricultural country. They were able to get the rural working population of Denmark educated to such a pitch that they were enabled to raise agriculture to a higher and better standard than in any other part of Europe. That is very real evidence of what can be done by an advanced adult education movement.
In this country as a young man I had the great happiness of teaching—and I would say that my own life work as a teacher started there—at the Working Men's College, which is the last surviving monument of the Christian Socialist Movement, of Frederick Dennison Maurice and that little band of men he gathered around him. Only a few years ago, the centenary of the foundation of the Working Men's College, which still exists and carries on its work in Mornington Crescent, was celebrated. This is the oldest of the adult educational colleges which still exist in this country and was, I think, the second to be formed. That is a long time ago. It was for a long time one of the few institutions of this kind to be carrying on the work of providing a liberal education, and many eminent men have passed through its classrooms. If one had the time it would be nice to dilate upon it, but obviously one has not.
Then we come to the foundation of the Workers' Educational Association, whose name is now a household word. I remember a struggling period before the First World War, and it is nice to hear that dynamic personality Albert Mansbridge recognised in your Lordships' House this afternoon. He came from the ranks of the working people, and joined forces with Harry Tawney, one of the friends on whom I look back with the greatest affection and esteem, in getting this wonderful work of adult education going among working people. Everybody must recognise what has been done by it.
The work of the W.E.A. in the interwar years really kept adult education of a liberal character going in this country, although from time to time it was confronted with real difficulties. It became obvious during the war years, when the Government themselves realised that the Armed Forces needed a great deal of education, that in the post-war years there would be great opportunities in the world of adult education and that great demands would be made. I confess that I do not really feel that we have quite lived up to those opportunities or answered those great demands.
In the Association of University Teachers, with which I have been happy to be associated for a very long time, this was realised and we had committees working on educational problems in the post-war period. I think that I can congratulate my colleagues on this, for, if you were to go back to what was published by the Association in 1944–45, before the end of the war, in regard to higher education generally, you would find that it very much foreshadowed the Robbins Report. At that time its fruition was a long way away and nobody paid a great deal of attention to it, but there is not really much in the Robbins Report that was not foreshadowed in the publications of the Association.
In the same way we produced what I think was a very valuable assessment of the position and needs in adult education, in which we pictured the university as the focus for regional education and development in the adult world. We foresaw many ways in which the university could help and, of course, to some extent that has been carried out, in that the extra-mural departments in the universities are playing a considerable part in the work of adult education at the present time. No doubt eventually this report of the Association of University Teachers in which the university is the focus of regional education will receive the same sort of recognition from the Government and from the community as a whole that the Robbins Report received very nearly twenty years later.
If one looks at this problem of adult education, one finds there are four aspects which require attention. Naturally at this stage I do not propose to develop all of them at length. First of all, there is the rather obvious one of the evening institutes, which go back a very long way; the evening schools for technical education, education for commerce, education of the kind which if a boy or girl had stayed at school a little longer he or she might well have received there. This has been the most successful part of adult education in this country.
The value of the work done by local education authorities in these institutes has hardly had the recognition that it deserves. When I was working for the Civil Defence movement during the war, I had a great deal to do with the selecting of men for officer rank in the National Fire Service and in the general service of Civil Defence, and it was astonishing how many of the men who presented themselves for promotion and were obviously well equipped for these positions had attended technical and commercial schools and colleges with great success. What we should have done without those men who had given up some years of early working life, not only working through the day in factories, workshops and offices but in the evenings in the technical schools, I shudder to think. This work will go forward, I do not think it needs very much encouragement from your Lordships' House.
Then there are the refresher courses. This sort of work in the evening institutes leads on to the refresher courses which are becoming more and more evident in the professions, and in the higher forms of scientific production and elsewhere, but in which there is still enormous scope for development. It is on this aspect of adult education that Robbins devotes most of the "two encouraging pages" to which I have already referred. Undoubtedly this is a very important aspect of adult education and one which will become more and more important, because in so many ways the men on whom we shall rely for the future economic and industrial progress of this country, especially in what one might call the "non-commissioned-officer ranks", will have to go through a great deal more education of this kind, partly in special colleges and partly in the colleges which already exist.
We then have the third group, the one on which there has been most comment this afternoon, the movement to bring the adult population as a whole up to date in regard to the knowledge without which the modern world is really incomprehensible and without which the adult citizen cannot really take his place in the modern world. This, I think, has never been better brought out than in the Memorial which was addressed by the Institute of Adult Education to the Minister of Education some time ago, and if your Lordships will allow me I should like to quote very shortly from what was said there: The quality of society depends on personal self-respect and the willingness to accept obligations in adult life. This is what adult education promotes, and that is why the Government is largely responsible for assisting it. They then go on to set out five aspects of this matter. I wish to draw only one of these to your Lordships' attention, but it is, I think, particularly important in the context of what I have just been saying. It is this: The present level of economic prosperity is associated with the continued acceleration in the rate of change. At whatever level of intelligence, no education that ends in early life will in future be enough to maintain responsible understanding of the current of change, nor will it prepare people to make the personal adaptation in middle life that may be required of them. This seems to me to be of very great importance, and it is obviously here that the modern movement for adult education can play an increasingly important rôle.
Then, of course, we have what one might call the general cultural education, which was referred to particularly by the noble Baroness—music, the arts, literature. The "two cultures" goes back a long way beyond Lord Snow's famous lecture. The problem was realised by my colleagues in the Committee to which I have referred. The great service that Lord Snow has doze, of course, is to put it so attractively, so epigrammatically and in such a way as to bring it home to us all. We were waiting for somebody with his grasp and his literary ability to bring it home to the nation. This cultural aspect of adult education, obviously, is a very important matter, and it is here—just as much here as in the old universities, such as Cambridge, where Lord Snow was for a number of years on the staff—that it is important for the life of the community.
The problem, of course, bristles with difficulties. The question of facilities has been referred to—the grossly inadequate premises in. which a great deal of this work goes on, often in the evenings, in schools which have been used all day; in buildings which are thoroughly airless and often out of date, and where it is extremely difficult for the wretched students—and, indeed, for the teacher himself—to keep really awake. Then there is the problem over recruitment of staff, who are miserably paid, so that jobs often have to be taken by people who have already done a hard day's work and are not in the sort of state to stimulate their students.
I agree entirely with what the noble Lord, Lord Hill of Luton, said, about the fact that adult education requires proper teaching. The B.B.C. and the Independent Television, and the newspapers, do a great work of stimulation. But stimulation is not education, unless it can drive people on and induce people to enter classes where they actually come into personal con tact with the teacher, where they have to use their own minds, where they do not just sit and absorb the well-expressed passages from the talk; where, indeed, they have to take their notes home, and work on them and produce some homework for the teacher. Unless there is this side, anybody who has been engaged in much teaching will tell you that the permanent effect will amount to very little.
It has been said, I know—and there is a good deal of truth in it—that the only well-educated man is the self-educated man. But the number of men who have succeeded in educating themselves well, entirely by their own efforts, is very small. The number who have failed is enormously larger. The number who might have succeeded if they had had real guidance and help as to how to get on with the work of educating themselves would be very large indeed.
One of our difficulties is that we do not know a great deal in a scientific way about what happens. The noble Baroness gave us a figure of one million people engaged in the evenings in all sorts of different classes of adult education. It would be a good thing to know in considerable detail what they are doing, how far they are going. This is an area of education of which, despite all the work that has been going on in recent years in general educational research, very little concrete is yet known. I would appeal to the new Minister of Education, and those who are working with him, to give attention to the essential need for research in this particular field.
One of the aspects of the matter to which they might address especial attention is that of inducing people into adult education. We tend to assume, as Sir Ben Bowen Thomas says in his interesting address, to which I have already referred more than once, that "people ought to be involved in adult education on terms already formulated for them by others". We want to know a great deal more about what they really need. We are living in a world in which people are being enticed in all sorts of directions by all sorts of interests with axes to grind. A young man—or a middle-aged man, for that matter—may start the winter months by determining that he will go through a course in a college of adult education, but within a few weeks he has been lured away by something gaudy and attractive, meretricious but of no real value. How can one expect him to resist this sort of blandishment and enticement? What we want, and what I should like the Ministry of Education to concentrate on, is the exploration of methods by which people can be induced to provide a real demand, not just a lackadaisical up-and-down demand, of the kind which starts quite strongly in October but has petered out by Easter, which, as everybody who has been much in the adult educational world knows, is one of the great dangers there.
Of course in a real Socialist country this would be very much easier. There are all sorts of inducements that could be held out to people. It is very difficult to get into the National Theatre: since the Old Vic became the National Theatre, I have hardly ever succeeded in getting seats. You could hold out, as they would at the Bolshoi, in Moscow, the possibility of giving what I might call most-favoured-nation treatment to people who did well in the adult education classes round the corner at Morley College. That would be one sort of inducement for people to come into adult education. It seems to me that this is an aspect of the matter which it is very important we should study, and into which research should be conducted. Because we have to get a very much larger number of the ordinary people of the country, who are involved in this dynamic society in which we all live, into this movement, so that they do not cease their education at the age of fifteen—or, as it is going to be, sixteen—but take it right through their whole lives, so that, when they come to retire, they will have a real basis of educational knowledge on which they can enjoy fruitfully the last few years of their lives.

LORD FRANCIS-WILLIAMS My Lords, I must confess to your Lordships that I found myself a little daunted this week-end when brooding about this debate. I picked up a copy of The Times Educational Supplement and found embedded in a book review the magisterial utterance: The truth is that adult education, though eminently worthy of respect, is not inherently an exciting subject. I hope that the debate to-day, so far as it has already gone, will permeate into Printing House Square and persuade them that this is not the case. I was delighted to hear the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill, introducing the debate, and also the noble Lord, Lord Hill of Luton, whom I congratulate on a most able and graceful maiden speech; I hope we are going to hear him a great deal, as he has an immense talent for the dissemination of knowledge of all kinds, and it would be a great pity, I think, if it were, so to speak, to be entirely decentralised in administrative activities. I hope he will come and join us often.
I was delighted to hear both of them paying the tributes they did to the W.E.A. Anybody on this side of the House, or anybody who has been in any way connected with the Labour Movement, whether political or industrial, will be well aware that one of the great influences in bringing the Labour Movement to maturity in this country has been the W.E.A.: the stimulation of ideas, the search for knowledge that it helped to form—helped, I must admit, from time to time by Eton, Winchester, Haileybury and Wirral Grammar School. Nevertheless, this surge of working-class education, which was perhaps at its peak in many ways in the early part of this century and which made an immense impact, along with the Nonconformist Church and other institutions, upon the thinking of an enormous mass of people seeking out new frontiers to capture for themselves and others was of the greatest importance.
I find it regrettable, not only because of its past but because of its present, that in the Year Book of the National Institute of Adult Education the W.E.A. should feel compelled to note that the restriction of its teaching grant to about 75 per cent. and the recent freezing of class activity are inhibiting the kind of pilot developments in new educational methods that it would like to undertake. I greatly hope that when he comes to speak later in this debate, my noble friend Lord Bowden, speaking from the Front Bench, will be able to tell us that, despite the other economic problems and difficulties that manifestly confront us, the present Government are taking a new look at this problem of adult education and of the finance that is necessary to make it operate successfully, and will take advantage of the great opportunities of all kinds that exist for its expansion.
If the noble Lord, Lord Hill of Luton, will not think that I am poaching upon his preserves, I want to glance particularly at the extent to which the new techniques of television and radio can, so to speak, marry and be synthesised with the old techniques of the lecture room and the tutorial class to make a great advance in adult education. It seems to me that the problem, if it is a problem—though one prefers to think of it as an opportunity—falls into four main groups. There is first the demand, the sense, the feeling of a great number of people that in some way they wish to extend their liberal education, to have opened upon the world not only new windows but new doors through which they can enter into a whole corridor of rooms, each with its own riches and diversities.
It is, I think, the case that much of television and radio, even when not in any way professedly educational, has done a great deal to help that liberal education of ordinary people. In the criticism that is often made of television, frequently by people who regard. themselves as of a superior education, it should never be forgotten that in a great number of programmes, weekly affairs programmes, discussion programmes, documentaries, professedly cultural programmes and programmes which have nothing to do professedly with culture, radio and television, whether B.B.C. or Independent Television, have for immense numbers of people, enormously increased both the opportunities for knowledge and the capacity to enjoy knowledge.
Anybody who has spent some part of his time appearing on television and radio programmes and who has had people come up to him in the street to talk about those programmes, cannot but be aware of the extent to which many such programmes, although they have aimed quite properly to entertain, have also greatly broadened the frontiers of knowledge. If we are, as I believe we are, a much better educated community than we were, a community less surrounded by the narrow walls of prejudice and so on, then I think, along with the whole process of education, television and radio has a great deal of credit due to it on that account. I say that, as it seems to me, the first aspect of adult education is this provision, whether directly and ostensibly or almost by accident, of a liberal education which broadens the mind and widens the outlook; and although more cot ld always be done, I think that that is being done to a considerable degree by the instruments of mass communication which we now have at our command.
Then there is what I regard as the second aspect of this matter: those who, having been compelled to specialise from early in their youth, feel, as they leave school and get into other jobs, the need to explore educational opportunities, subjects which, so to speak, were put outside the bounds when they were working hard to pass examinations. We all should realise that although the need to pass an examination may be an essential purpose in an educational system, an essential qualification of proficiency in many professions and industries, and increasingly so, yet the degree of specialisation which is now so often insisted upon in sixth forms, and often below the sixth form, can carry with it the immense danger of creating a people of narrower skills and narrow knowledge, people who have "missed out" on a great deal of the infinite variety of exciting subjects and exciting material that is available to those who have enjoyed a wider education and who have been able to look at the world in human terms and with a humanitarian tradition.
I think it is a substantial purpose of adult education to provide the means whereby those who have been required to specialise in order to acquire the professional or trade qualifications necessary for earning a living and getting on in their career, shall, at a later stage in their lives, be able to go back to the well of knowledge and imbibe deeply in ways that they were not able to do when their noses were pressed to the grindstone of an examination system. Those people may not need an educational system, educational techniques which lead up to any kind of diploma or examination, or even the kind of written work that both Lord Hill of Luton and Lord Chorley have referred to and which I agree is essential if you are to have a goal of actual achievement which can be examined and recognised at the end of it. But what they need is not only an occasional programme which will open a window or a door, but carefully considered structures of programmes which will lead them on from a beginning to a middle, and later to a much higher stage of education in subjects which appeal to them—and I stress "which appeal to them".
Although I agree with a great deal of what my noble friend Lord Chorley had to say, I discerned here and there a trace of a feeling that somehow people ought to be given the education that was good for them, and that if they would not take it that way then they ought in some way to be bribed into accepting it, either by tickets for the National Theatre or in some other way. I do not really believe that, having once escaped the domination of the schoolmaster, the ordinary adult can be either bullied or bribed into an education for which he does not himself feel an inner urge. It is to inspire that kind of inner urge that I believe the instruments of mass communication could be immensely valuable. But there are, of course, those who need further education for explicit purposes, sometimes leading to diplomas and degrees, in order to prepare them for more skilled and responsible work in their vocations.
I looked back on what I thought was one of the most brilliant maiden speeches made in this House, that made by my noble friend Lord Bowden on the subject of business education, aware as he is—more aware than most people—of the immense national need that many millions of people in trade, in industry, and in the professions shall be able to improve their education technologically and in other respects, in order that we shall be able to take full advantage of opportunities of expansion in this country. I very much hope that he will be able to tell us, when he speaks towards the end of this debate, whether he has yet had time to impress even more fully upon the Government—and I know that many members of the Government are aware of it—the need for developing this kind of education and for using all the new techniques of teaching in making it possible to reach a mass audience.
All Governments—all new Governments—have to grapple with the problem of priorities. There are, manifestly, other immediate problems and issues which have to come before those of developing adult education, but I hope we shall receive an assurance that this, at any rate, is among the high priorities of this Government, not only because of the need to expand the horizons of our people, but also because, failing it, we shall fall behind in that advance of technology, of industrial expansion, upon which the well-being and survival of our country depends.
Fourthly, of course—and this has already been done to some extent—is the need in adult education for refresher courses for those who are already engaged in some profession who may have reached their middle period, or even be past it, and who are very busy and occupied, yet need to have means provided whereby they can keep up with the latest developments, the latest knowledge, learning and skills in their professions. It seems to me that in this matter television and radio, which can go right into the home of the busy professional man, provide an immense opportunity for the refresher course, as is already being done to some extent, as the noble Lord, Lord Hill of Luton, mentioned, in Scottish Television, which has had a refresher course for general practitioners.
Considering these various aspects of this problem, as I see it, I asked myself how we ought to bend our minds best to grapple with it. There was a good deal of talk at one time, although the Pilkington Committee rather turned it down, of the idea of a fourth television channel which would be entirely educational. Quite frankly, I am in two minds on this. I do not believe, as the Pilkington Committee seemed to believe, that if an educational channel were established it would mean that the other television companies and organisations—the B.B.C., but particularly, thought the Pilkington Committee, the independent television companies—would use it as an excuse for dropping their present number of serious programmes. I do not believe that to be the case at all. When I say that I am in two minds about it, it is in part because so much of the education of this country has been locally based. has been inspired by the knowledge of local needs and local conditions, that I sometimes feel a certain revulsion of horror at the idea of a supreme body which would be completely in control of education by television, and perhaps also by radio, operating from the centre.
When I was for a time at the University of California, in Berkeley, briefly occupying a position beyond my educational station as a visiting professor, I was much impressed at being approached and asked if I should be agreeable to a course of post-graduate seminars being televised in order that they could go into an educational station. I agreed, and immediately it had a powerful impact on the students who were participating in my post-graduate seminars. The girls appeared before me infinitely better dressed and smarter than they had been before, and the young men had obviously spent the night before brushing up their knowledge. After the first slight inhibitions provided by the know ledge that they were all on the screen, they did in fact forget, as people who are on television do forget, all about the medium, and we conducted what was in essence exactly the same kind of post-graduate seminar as we should normally have conducted.
I was enormously interested at the number of letters which later flooded into me from all kinds of people—from housewives, technical workers, office workers—people who had viewed those programmes, who had followed the seminars right through, and gave me for a period more or less a full-time job in answering the queries which they wrote to me in their letters. I wonder whether we could not contemplate perhaps more carefully than we have done so far whether we could not develop both local radio and local television linked to the universities, and particularly perhaps to the new universities. I think particularly of the University of Sussex because I happen to know something about it. It is at present conducting, so I am told, a most fascinating research into the social aspects and implications of certain kinds of mass communication, particularly the Press, on which it wrote to me about a number of points.
These new universities might join with the local education authorities, with the local adult education associations like the W.E.A. and, I should also think, with some of the existing correspondence colleges. Some of the correspondence colleges are extremely good; some of them, I am told, are rather bad; but perhaps we have reached the stage where they ought to be examined and registered as schools are by the Ministry of Education, in order that we and their pupils may know what their merits or demerits are. One thinks of a consortium of the university, the adult educational institute, the local authority and the correspondence college, planning courses of adult education, both of a liberal arts kind and of a technological and scientific kind, using and having made available to them local radio stations and, if possible—and I do not believe that it is impossible—local television outlets.
I believe, after spending many years in this field in one way and another, that there is an immense amount of nonsense talked about the expense of television programmes. Of course great spectaculars or international documentaries cost a tremendous amount of money. But a television programme aimed at a particular audience for a particular educational purpose, handled by a producer with knowledge, who knows that he does not have an immense budget to fall back on, can be produced—I know, because I have helped to do it—for very little money indeed. I believe that if we could have this amalgam, this synthesis, of these various agencies of either actual or potential adult education, then indeed we might find ways of using the new technique open to us in a way which would really take advantage of the opportunities that now exist. That we must take advantage of those opportunities I am convinced, because upon whether we do or not will depend not only the efficiency of our society, but its quality.

BARONESS GAITSKELL My Lords, this debate has so far been conducted on such a gentle note that I hesitate to ruffle the atmosphere by a slightly controversial speech. I think that the biggest indictment of the late Government is not so much the present economic crisis—for we seem to have a chronic balance-of-payments problem which flares up periodically—as the inadequate state of all our education to-clay after thirteen years of Conservative rule. There are certain phrases used by politicians which catch on and are accepted without any questioning. Such a phrase was the time-worn, "You've never had it so good." It planted a seed of complacency that has taken root and spread like a weed, and I think it had an effect on the moral climate of this country. I hasten to add, in case your Lordships should misunderstand me, that I use the word "moral" not in its sexual sense, but in its spiritual meaning; and I use the word "spiritual" not in its religious sense, but with its intellectual connotation.
How else can one explain the apathetic attitude to education generally which has prevailed in the last ten years? I know that we have had inquiries, reports, articles and discussions galore. They have all come to one conclusion; that we must have more and better education. Each branch, primary, secondary, university and adult, has claimed to be the Cinderella of the education services; but adult education is the poorest of them all. How can we have been so deluded about our national well-being when, in comparison with the Soviet Union and America, after allowances for differences in population, the Robbins Report has stated that, if we compare published plans for future development in education many other countries are far ahead of us?
This is all the more serious because we know that we can neither hold our own nor compete unless we have a highly educated population to give us the many skilled people of whom we are so short now and who are essential to our progress. How can any society to-day be complacent with such a grave shortage of teachers as we have? Judging by the Robbins Report, we shall need a quarter of a million more teachers in 1980 for higher education. Last year, 5,000 students who had qualified for the universities could not find places, for they did not exist. And it looks as if next year the figure will be still higher. This in itself makes the need for adult education greater than ever. A great deal of money will have to be spent, and used wisely and fairly as between the different sections of education.
As I have said, my Lords, adult education is the youngest and the most neglected child of them all. I have a special interest in adult education, and I hope that your Lordships will forgive me if for a moment I am a little personal. My husband, Hugh Gaitskell, as my noble friend Lord Greenhill has said, after having the best education that money can buy in this country became a university extra-mural tutor at Nottingham. His first job was with the Workers' Educational Association in the Nottingham district, teaching economics to a class of unemployed miners. He taught these miners in various villages; and he learned a great deal from them, too. It was because of his great interest in them that he had an association with the mining industry which he valued and maintained throughout his life. He was Vice-President of the W.E.A. from 1952 until his death. This partnership which existed in the East Midlands between the W.E.A. and the University led to a great expansion of the courses throughout the towns and villages; and this, in turn, led to all kinds of experiments which have given a new look to adult education.
The most successful new development is the one with industry. Day-release courses for mineworkers and industrial workers are an important feature. Many of the courses are held in factories immediately after work ends, and both public and privately owned industries support this scheme. Since 1951, however, many restrictions have been placed on adult education, which have frustrated the work and prevented advantage being taken of the great and growing demand for it. It is the same theme song: shortage of staff, shortage of education, and shortage of funds. Where local authorities have been able to provide suitable centres, there has been a dramatic increase in student numbers.
The total national expenditure on education, so often quoted, is £1,000 million: the Government's total estimated aid up to date to responsible bodies in adult education is under £1 million—less than the cost of one mile of motorway. In 1952, grants to the extra-mural departments of universities and the W.E.A. were limited, and this restrictive policy was continued, except for brief periods of relaxation. By 1962, only 1 per cent. of the adult population, 200,000, were taking part in adult education. Sir Edward Boyle granted a small increase in the direct grants in order to provide some more full-time tutors, as distinct from part-time. There is a growing need to-day for these. The universities asked for 62, and they were given 15: the W.E.A. asked for 13, and they were given 5. At present, there is a standstill: there is no provision for any increase.
The argument is that we cannot advance simultaneously on all fronts. But, as I have said, the fact that so many young people cannot get into a university, in spite of being qualified to do so, makes the need for adult education really pressing. In this particular field a modest increase in expenditure can produce a vast improvement. The benefits of tutor-student, person-to-person teaching simply cannot be exaggerated. It is the most valuable method of all.
Of late, there has been much talk about a University of the Air—and here may I add my congratulations to the noble Lord, Lord Hill of Luton, for a really exceptional maiden speech? I think he was almost too modest about the experiments and the ventures of I.T.V. in this field of a University of the Air. The National Extension College, as it is called, has got off the ground after some very interesting experiments and research conducted by the Advisory Centre of Education, in conjunction with Cambridge University and I.T.V.
At first, I was somewhat sceptical about the practical future of this venture. I know how much the Russians are said to use this method, but I thought that it was from necessity and not from choice. But the results of the series of programmes put out by "Dawn University" from Cambridge, combined with correspondence courses and occasional residential courses, have been absolutely spectacular. The public have been left with a great appetite for more. This success is remarkable. The most outstanding and brilliant lectures have been used, and this is certainly a way to bridge the gulf between the ordinary citizen and the specialist in the sciences and the arts. Science, particularly, is absolutely incomprehensible to the ordinary citizen, and if we do not make some greater effort at communication soon there will not be just many accents but two separate languages; that of the specialist and that of the man in the street, with never the twain meeting.
The University of the Air is still in embryo, and to be properly effective it must be combined with correspondence courses, as I have said, and high-standard examinations. It can be an important way of equipping and enticing married women teachers back into the profession, where they are so badly needed. We have 160,000 qualified women teachers in this country: 40,000 of them are not at work. Part-time teachers could easily be drawn back by these refresher methods. The broadcasting techniques are still pretty imperfect, I am told, and not very polished: but when these have been perfected, and links between different universities established, a University of the Air can be as well equipped as any university on the ground and can reach a vastly greater number of students.
Other ideas have been put forward, my Lords—some more original than practical. Dr. Beeching has had a proposal for a travelling classroom on trains for commuters. One can go on ad absurdum. Why not an observatory on top of the Hilton Hotel, or of the Shell building? The imagination boggles at the opportunities opening up to-day for adult education. But if we dismiss this as nonsense, let us remember that a television-based teaching time from 6.30 to 8.30 has had a successful rehearsal at university level. I hope that the Government will promote all practical innovations, especially for extra-mural and W.E.A. projects, because, as I have already said, a small increase in expenditure will yield very big results.
Perhaps we are so accustomed to our democratic way of life that we do not pause to think that it is by no means universal. Perhaps we do not cherish our democracy enough. Adult education is a good and easy way to mix people from every walk of life; and it is a way to give those who have missed their opportunity a second chance, or even a last chance, to educate themselves. When one contemplates a growing democracy, there is only one thing that is slightly depressing, and that is a growing uneducated democracy. I hope that the Government will put adult education high on the list of priorities in education generally.

LORD GEDDES OF EPSOM My Lords, I am always diffident when intervening in a debate at this point, because repetition is wearisome; nevertheless, it seems to me unavoidable. The first point I want to make—and I have a reason for making it—is that the Trades Union Congress and the trade unions make a very considerable contribution in the adult education field. I make this point because I am often being asked, "Why don't the trade unions educate their members?". It is not generally known that the contribution of the trade unions to adult education is something like £300,000 a year. This may not be a very great sum in relation to the total spent, but it is nevertheless a not inconsiderable sum; and the Trades Union Congress allocates about 20 to 25 per cent. of its total income to educating its members.
Of course, one of the reasons why the question is asked is that the questioner really means, "Why don't the trade unions educate their members to accept all that the employers say?" This is an assumption, you know: that if the pupil knows as much as the master, then agreement is inevitable. I do not accept that at all: I think it is a false assumption. I think it is at this point that controversy really starts. It may be better informed, but, in my view, it is often much more bitter. But I want to concentrate, if I may, on just two aspects of adult education. The first is education for the young adult, and the other is television and radio, to which reference has already been made, particularly in the splendid maiden speech by the noble Lord, Lord Hill of Luton. He certainly knows far more about it than I do; but perhaps I shall be a little more critical than one would expect him to be in looking at television's contribution in one particular aspect to which I hope to refer.
My Lords, when talking about education for the young. we are undoubtedly raising the question of education for leisure. In this group we have those people who, by their ability and inclinations, are well-fitted to enjoy the benefits of the affluent society. We need to worry little about these. The far larger group, among whom we find the vandals, the "Mods" and the "Rockers", will never be appealed to by our present approaches to adult education. These are the people who, as the working week becomes shorter (and this it seems to me is inevitable) are creating our most serious problems in adult education.
No one seems to have found a successful recipe for occupying the leisure time of the less intellectually able members of the community, and we have only the sketchiest notions of motivation for group anti-social behaviour like the Margate and Brighton occurrences and the vandalism of the football trains. Glib explanations, that they have too much money, or glib cures, that we should bring back the birch, are not likely to get us anywhere. I have few helpful ideas; but I should like to put these forward, whether they are acceptable or not. First, we should take a less academic view of some of the features of adult education and allow our public expenditure to flow more easily into activities such as games—and this is meant to cover a wide range of entertaining activities usually outside the scope of culture. This would mean taking the Albemarle Report seriously and giving more substantial support to youth activity generally.
Secondly, we should link adult education for the less intellectual with some of the social service activities. For dealing with the anti-social part of the population we should ensure that we encourage recruitment of able and sympathetic people by adequate status and rewards; and I think your Lordships would agree with me that the Probation Service has suffered in recent years from poor monetary rewards. Third, we should encourage more research into the causes of anti-social behaviour. Much research of this type is carried out on a shoe-string; but until recently there have been no formal mechanisms for support by Government analogous with that for physical science. Until we have some understanding of why people behave anti-socially, we shall be floundering around in trying to abate bad behaviour by providing alternative attractions; and we certainly have not succeeded yet.
This might be a little startling, but as my fourth suggestion I would say that we might consider the possibility of nonmilitary National Service which could cover, under disciplined procedures, many facets of social service, such as aid to the old, hospital service, service in underdeveloped countries, agriculture, et cetera. I appreciate that this concentrates rather on the anti-social and delinquent, because this is where the most serious problem lies. Far from removing sources of trouble, affluence and leisure will aggravate the problem. Therefore, I think it necessary that we should consider it very seriously indeed.
My Lords, turning to radio and television, I would remark that it is reported that the Centre for Educational Television Overseas is holding a conference in London this week. This will concentrate on education in newly-developing countries. But what about this country? In the Year Book of the National Institute of Adult Education the following statement is made: Television adds tin exciting new dimension to Adult Education. This is not merely because its techniques, if properly directed, can enliven the study of subjects as different as art and international relations, but because of its social hold as a medium. Is it properly directed, and does it promote international relations? I have profound doubt about this. Attempts to educate through plays with the colour bar as their theme seldom educate the public in this difficult question. The "antis" become more "anti" and the "pros" more confirmed and bitter. Programmes on youth and their trials and tribulations do little or nothing to relieve their burdens or to increase the sympathy of the "squares" with youth's strange desire to "get with it." Documentaries about small coloured religious sects performing ritual dances only increase one's bewilderment. They do nothing to create a greater understanding between the races; and publicity about strange religious bigots does nothing to increase respect for the Christian doctrine. The one overwhelming need to-day is for greater understanding as a prelude to tolerance. Knowledge may breed prejudice; but deep understanding seldom does.
Cannot the two broadcasting authorities set up a joint study group to consider the type of programme which will bring greater understanding among the peoples of the world? if they cannot, or will not, cannot the Government set up such a Committee? There is an imperative need for understanding the causes of distrust which arise from a complete lack of comprehension of the problems of other people. Why, for example, in starving India does the population increase at such a rate? Let us see a day in the life of an Indian family, in a small Indian village community—not made entertaining by village dances and women carrying water on their heads, but rather how they live (if that is the correct description) from dawn to dusk of a very ordinary day.
Surely much more can be done without too much interference with the entertainment value of present programmes. Instead of pleasant commentaries by pleasant and clever young men about the modern miracle of rubber production, let us see the life of one family whose only crop is rubber and let us see how they live for five years on the £90 which they receive for changing over to more productive trees. What sort of education do their children get? What food do they eat? What luxuries do they have? Let us share their miseries for a change. There is plenty of misery in the world to make many such programmes. This may not be entertainment; but it would be excellent education for the Western affluent society.
I expect to be told that this could not be done; that the public would not stand for it. But we might be surprised how much the public would welcome being educated away from the antics and petty doings of the residents in "Coronary Thrombosis Street". At the worst it would be a change, and at the best, adult education of the most worthy kind. Let the B.B.C. take their courage in their hands; and if the sponsors of soap powder advertisements will not stand for it, let the Government make a grant. They can, and do, spend money on less worthy objects.

LORD DARWEN My Lords, I should like to follow in some respects the noble Lord who has just sat down. I feel that his plea that we should look at adult education in a rather wider way is, perhaps, a right one, and at one point in these brief remarks I should like to look at that. I think it is true to say that adult education was founded on inequality of opportunities in school education. This state of affairs is one which is changing, and consequently it is necessary that the people who are concerned with adult education should look again at the aims and means of adult education.
One of the most pressing tasks facing the present Government is the advancement of technological education. I think very few noble Lords would disagree with that. If we do not create a great many more scientists and technicians, it is recognised that our economy will suffer immensely and that we as a nation will no longer have an important rôle in the councils of the world. These phrases are useful for the legislator and the economist, but they lack a certain personal dimension. The ideas they represent are, of course, as we all know, very much concerned with persons. If the economy suffers, people are thrown out of work and those who have work are paid less. Not only does their relative affluence disappear, but poverty and the fight to stay alive draw a step nearer. Again, if we lose our place in the councils of the world, the world may become a most hostile place and we may lose our freedom to speak as we think.
I should like to push a little further this question of why we consider technological education to be important. Technology gives us power, wealth and, although it does not appear yet, fewer hours in which we must work. But power, wealth and fewer hours each poses its own question. Power for what? Wealth for what? Leisure for what? To this last question, "Leisure for what?", as indeed to the others, the relevance of education is obvious. We need to think about education for leisure because leisure is one of the principal fruits of the technological age, and the fruitful use of leisure can, in its turn, reflect a new quality into technological thinking. One can enrich the other.
Adult education is voluntary education. It is an aspect of a free society, having the aim of enabling people to decide for themselves. As we have heard during the course of this debate, adult education in this country has been most effectively represented by the university extra-mural classes and by the W.E.A. It would not be my wish in any way to belittle the tremendous achievement of these two main agencies. The discipline of these two organisations was well founded and it has enabled them to survive, because their standards are essentially in the best tradition of scholarship. But there are a great many other organisations which provide classes and recreational activi- ties of all kinds—Townswomen's Guilds, with over 200,000 members, and with classes in social studies, crafts and drama; the Women's Institutes; the National Association of Women's Clubs; the Y.M.C.A. and Y.W.C.A.; and the residential colleges run by a variety of bodies, including local education authorities and, in some cases, universities. Besides these, there are, of course, all the classes and courses which are provided by the local education authorities themselves.
Nearly twenty years ago, I was appointed a warden of an adult education settlement. There were classes in clay modelling, needlework, orchestral music, drama, poetry interpretation, art, ballroom dancing, philosophy and a great many more subjects. At that time I had two ideas, and I am inclined to think that they were both just a little wrong. The first was that classes of the more academic type were much more valuable than recreational classes. I think that I probably thought in the wrong terms. I should have thought that they were more educational rather than more valuable. One can see that recreational activities can play an important rôle in emotional adjustments, in domestic upheavals and so forth and, in general, in making life more enjoyable.
The other idea I had was that the personal touch was extremely important. But the personal touch depends on the person and on just precisely what one means by it. The responsibility for the personal touch lay rather heavily upon me, and I remember an early social evening at which I did my best to get round, shaking hands and saying a few words to everyone I had not already met. Towards the end of the evening I saw a young man who was new to me. I went up to him, greeted him and said that I hoped I should see him again before very long. His reply was withering: "I gathered that. This is the third time you have told me so this evening."
The question of whether personal participation has an interaction between teacher and taught, between student and student, is one which deserves far more attention than it has had. I had very much hoped that I should be able to bring to your Lordships some data of research into this subject, but I have been singularly unsuccessful in discovering any. But, in view of the power of television and radio as means of providing both formal and informal education, this is a subject which ought to have the attention of a suitable research investigation. The best I have been able to do is to find a brief passage in a "Pelican", by W. J. H. Sprott, with the title, Human Groups. On page 157 the author mentions the work of Kurt Lewin, a German psychologist who did his most important work in the United States. Lewin was interested in the way in which people were influenced by various methods of persuasion. This is not adult education, of course, because adult education, as I have said, aims at enabling people to make their own decisions. Nevertheless, the results of Lewin's experiments seem to me relevant, and I should like to read a few sentences. He says: During World War II it was felt necessary to persuade housewives in America to serve offal to their husbands. To those who are only too glad to get hold of sweetbreads and kidneys, this will seem odd, but the fact remains that to the American housewife 'intestinals' were looked upon askance. Two techniques were used: attractive lectures on the nutritional value of such foods, and group discussions leading to a group decision. A follow-up survey showed that the latter method was overwhelmingly more successful. The same thing was done to induce mothers to get their families to consume more milk and their babies to consume more orange juice. There is certainly a place in adult education for people who are getting on in years and perhaps are dreading the thought of retirement. Yesterday I heard of a man who went along to a city literary institution to take a course for retirement. During the course it was impressed upon those attending that they should try to get some interest, to take up a hobby. The suggestion was put to this man that perhaps he might like to take one of the courses at the institute. But he protested that he had no intellectual pretensions, that he was an ordinary working man and was not equipped to enter upon such courses. In the end he agreed to take up painting. A year later, the lecturer who had suggested that he should take such a course met him in the corridor and asked him how he was getting on. The man said that he was in rather a hurry because lie was late for his class, but at least he could say this: as a result of taking the painting course that year he had seen spring for the first time. Employers who send their apprentices to W.E.A. group classes may appear to be taking a very long view; but there is no doubt that, from the point of view of the community, such group discussions vitalise members. They are perhaps less tractable, but they are certainly more interesting and have more to contribute.
A good deal has been said about the effect of television. I do not want to be repetitious, and I will say only a little about this, although I had intended to develop it at some length. Even if the programmes are not thought of in terms of education, there is no doubt that most factual programmes, many discussion programmes and programmes about art, dance music and the theatre all help people to be more discerning. Above all, they make for an awareness of the possibilities within and outside a person. As one viewer put it, "Television has the advantage of blessed anonymity". I particularly remember Dr. Bronowski's splendid lectures on science. I believe the B.M.A. were clearly doubtful about the idea of televising operations and the treatment of various ailments, but, as the series progressed, they became convinced of the value of such programmes. This is clearly an attempt to persuade people to adopt a better attitude to certain diseases and forms of treatment. It is probably valuable, but it is not adult education, as defined.
So I come back to my belief that the best kind of learning involves an interaction—this has been stressed by many people—between teacher and taught. The noble Lord, Lord Hill of Luton, in his able maiden speech referred to the successful course under the auspices of A.T.V. and Nottingham University. The only thing I would add to what has been said about this is that I understand the results were that 1,500 people paid the s. enrolment fee and another 1,500 paid for the handbook. This is perhaps a curious way of deciding upon the success of a course, but it is not so much below the cost which is paid for the more traditional type of class.
In conclusion, my Lords, I would express the hope that the Government will provide whatever small sum may be needed—and, relatively speaking, it is a small sum—in order that some centrally organised body, such as the National Institute of Adult Education, or any other body, may take a good hard look at what has been done in other countries, and, above all, do some long overdue research into the conditions in which adult education can most effectively be carried out.

LORD ABERDARE My Lords, I feel that we all owe a great debt of gratitude to the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill, for this opportunity to debate the subject of adult education. He began his speech with a most graceful tribute to other noble Lords, both past and present, who had contributed much to the cause of adult education; but I am sure we all feel that he himself is deserving of inclusion in this category, as he has given a great deal of service to adult education in Scotland. The noble Lord introduced a debate on the same subject, as I remember, in March, 1960. I had the pleasure of taking part in that debate, and the one thing I remember about the occasion is the noble Earl who is now the Leader of the House recollecting some very pleasant experiences he had when he was a member of the Conservative Party.
I should also like to join with other noble Lords who have expressed their admiration of the maiden speech of the noble Lord, Lord Hill of Luton. I hope that it is not presumptuous of me, being a recently new appearer at this Dispatch Box, to say how much I enjoyed listening to his speech, and how much we all hope he will address us on many future occasions.
I feel that this debate on adult education has rather completed a cycle of debates that we have had in this House on various aspects of education as a whole. We have now had debates on primary education, secondary education and further education. Last week we were debating education for management, and now this debate seems to round off the cycle. Since your Lordships' last debate on this subject, that initiated by the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill, in 1960, we have had the publication of the Robbins Report, which has been referred to to-day. And I must say that I personally found the Appendix to that Report, which was criticised by the noble Lord, Lord Chorley, most useful and helpful, for it summarises the different bodies involved in adult education and gives some useful facts and figures about them. The noble Lord, Lord Darwen, mentioned some of these bodies, but I think there is no harm in reminding ourselves of what these various agencies are.
There are the evening institutes run by the local education authorities, at which some 700,000 people over 21 were registered in 1963. There are the major establishments, the technical colleges and colleges of art, and other colleges, which may be providing further education courses during the day. It is estimated that there are some 200,000 enrolments in these colleges. There are the colleges of adult education, maintained or assisted by the local education authorities, of which 28 are running short residential courses.
Then there are the bodies of which we have perhaps heard most in this debate to-day, the so-called responsible bodies, which included the Workers' Educational Association, the Extra-Mural Departments of Universities, the Cornwall Adult Education Joint Committee, and the Welsh Council of Y.M.C.A.s. There are also the voluntary organisations, particularly referred to by my noble friend Lady Elliot of Harwood, in her interesting remarks, which included the subject of consumer education; and there are the residential colleges, of which there are seven in England and Wales, running courses of up to two years in length.
The other interesting thing, to me, which emerges from the Robbins Report, and which was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Darwen, is the fact that there are, in broad terms, two different types of student who are making use of adult education. First, there are those who have been educated beyond the minimum school leaving age and who, for various reasons, want to continue their education or to learn subjects which they did not study at school. The significant thing about this category is that it accounts for the majority of students attending classes in adult education. Secondly, there are those mainly employed in manual or routine clerical occupations, who are in a minority as a whole yet form the majority in the long-term residential colleges. It seems to me likely that, as educational facilities improve, this tendency will increase; and whereas adult education organisations have done excellent work in the past in filling the deficiencies in the educational system, we now face a new situation in which they will have to provide more and more, for those who have already had a formal education up to the age of fifteen or later. It is significant in this connection that there is no reduction in demand. In fact, there is an increase, but it is of a different nature from that to which we were accustomed in the past.
Now I should like to come to the subject of Government grants to adult education. I do nor want to debate with the noble Baroness, Lady Gaitskell, the subject of education as a whole. We have had plenty of opportunities in the past of differing in our views of what may or may not have been done in education, but I do not think that this is the time or the place to start a debate on that subject. I am sure we shall have plenty of opportunity on future occasions. Suffice it to say that those of us who sit on this side of the House could not possibly agree with her that the educational programme of the late Government was other than a great success. All of us are aware that there are difficulties, that there are shortages of teachers, and that we may still not have enough schools. But these are problems with which I have no doubt noble Lords opposite are now having to wrestle and scratch their heads about.
I should like new to say something about the Government grants to adult education. These are grants to those responsible bodies towards their teaching costs; grants to voluntary organisations towards their administrative expenses—not their teaching costs; and grants to five of the seven residential colleges. Of course, there always arise difficulties of priority when it comes to allocating money. However, it is worthy of notice that in ten years, from 1954–55 to 1964–65, the amount of money made available in grants to adult education increased by over double, from a figure of £390,000 to a figure of £34,000-odd, and that in the same period the number of full-time posts was increased from 254 to 311.
I am sure that none of us who are interested in adult education will ever think that enough money is devoted to it. Nevertheless, there are priorities, and all we can do is to press the present Government to increase their expenditure; and I am sure we shall look forward to hearing from the noble Lord who is to reply to-day that they are going to do so. I am as keen as anybody to increase these grants, and I must confess that I have a personal interest. I am President of the Welsh Council of Y.M.C.A.s, which is one of the responsible bodies. I will only say to the noble Lord, Lord Bowden, that after I spoke last, in March, 1960, our grant was increased from £700 to £1,000, and it has not been increased since—so perhaps he may take the hint.
There is an ever-increasing demand in Wales for adult education. The number of lectures constantly rises, and in the last year there were some 3,000 students, as against some 2,700 in the previous year. We have also commenced a new experiment by appointing a full-time organiser to work with discussion groups in industry. This experiment has had a remarkable response, and in the year 1963–64 the gentleman concerned made over 350 visits to the thirteen participating firms, and conducted an average of 70 group meetings each month. We were very grateful to the Carnegie Trust for a grant to get this work started, and although the grant has now come to an end I am glad to say that industry has been sufficiently impressed by the work done to meet the costs of continuing it. We are very grateful, too, to the Glamorgan Education Authority, who are also contributing. We also continue in Wales to run the college of Coleg y Fro at Rhoose, where the courses are mainly of a residential nature. This, too, is expanding, and we have plans for extensions to the college, but, once again, we are in need of increased financial support.
Several noble Lords mentioned the use of radio and television, and I am sure that we should all agree that in reappraising the whole programme of adult education it is particularly necessary to use modern methods to meet modern needs, and that radio and television are an outstanding example of what can be done in this way. Most of your Lordships spotlighted television but I think it is right that we should pay a tribute to what has been done in sound broadcasting towards adult education. For many years the B.B.C. has run a further education unit and has planned and produced adult education programmes. This activity still continues. The greater part of these programmes is now concentrated in what is called "Study Session", which is broadcast from  to  on five nights a week, and the audiences are estimated to vary from about 10,000 to 100,000 on different types of programmes.
I feel sure that the noble Baroness, Lady Gaitskell will be interested, if she does not already know, that a new programme was started in October under the title "A Second Start"—the noble lady indicates that she does know, and I apologise—which is designed specially to encourage women teachers who have left the schools on marriage to keep in touch with what is going on educationally and to return to the schools in due course. I I am sure all your Lordships who have expressed an interest in the past in increasing the number of teachers and, in particular, in inducing women teachers to return when their family responsibilities allow, will agree that this is a useful initiative.
So far as television is concerned, both the I.T.A. and the B.B.C. have taken quick advantage of the Conservative Government's agreement, when it was in power, to allow them extra hours of broadcasting if they broadcast adult education programmes on an agreed formula. Both organisations have set up their committees to advise them on adult education, and I think it is encouraging to know that Sir John Fulton is chairman of both committees, thereby avoiding any duplication between them, and also that there is a regular exchange of information between their planning staffs, equally to avoid duplication.
On the I.T.A. the main net-work programme is "Sunday Session" on Sunday mornings, for which an audience survey has given an average weekly audience of some three-quarters-of-a-million and also revealed, interestingly enough, that nearly half of those had not availed themselves of any formal course of education since leaving school. Another regional project conducted by I.T.A., for which I think they deserve our warm congratulations, is a programme entitled "The Full Man", which was a session of twelve thirty-minute programmes on English Literature transmitted at a peak hour on Tuesdays.
The B.B.C. in the year 1963–64 conducted nine series of adult education programmes on television on Saturday and Sunday mornings, with some repeats on weekdays after 11 p.m. Most of them were supported by illustrated pamphlets, and one of them, "Learning Italian", by two pronounciation records. The B.B.C. also has had the advantage of the coming into existence of B.B.C.2, and has devoted a major proportion of peak time on Tuesday evenings mainly to adult education; but, of course, B.B.C.2 does not yet enjoy national coverage.
I should like, in conclusion, to mention two of the main problems that seem to me to face the use of television for adult education. The first difficulty is that of the available time. Although audiences for these programmes are substantial in absolute terms, they are relatively small, and no television station can really afford to broadcast the programmes too often in peak viewing hours. But, of course, it is in these peak viewing hours that most of the people who want to see adult education programmes want to look-in. I mentioned the programme "The Full Man", courageously put on by Southern Television, and the B.B.C. programmes on B.B.C.2; but even B.B.C.2 has to compete with B.B.C.1 and the independent programmes, and as in most homes there is only one television set, there may well be a considerable difference of opinion among the family as to who is going to see what; and I should imagine that the adult who wanted to see the adult education programme on B.B.C.2 might find it difficult to substantiate his claim.
I should like to mention, though, in this connection, a most interesting experiment conducted by the Islington librarian who made viewing facilities available in his reading rooms so that local adults who were interested in following an adult education programme could go there and look in on their own. This suggests to one's mind that this service would not only overcome the difficulty of competition in looking at the set, but would also enable further instruction and more personal guidance to be carried on at the same time.
This is the second problem that I would mention—this question of "follow-up", as it is called in educational programmes. The noble Lord, Lord Hill of Luton, spoke eloquently on this subject. He called it "T.V. plus" and stressed the great importance in any kind of adult education through television of having this little extra personal supervision and follow-through at the end of the programme. I think other noble Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord Chorley, also voiced their support to this view. I am sure that this can best be done by working through the existing adult education organisations. There is a tremendous job of organisation to be done, but one that will be well worth doing.
The noble Lord, Lord Francis-Williams, and the noble Baroness, Lady Gaitskell, both mentioned the possibility of a fourth educational channel. I feel that we want to look at this suggestion most carefully. It has many attractions at first sight, but ii also has its difficulties. It is undoubtedly something that would be expensive to provide, and it would be a pity if a lot of money and effort were wasted with disappointing results. Such a channel would, of course, again run up against the difficulty of having to compete with other channels and would also perhaps be in difficulties over the follow-up unless this were carefully organised.
I would draw your Lordships' attention to a very good leading article on this subject in The Times Educational Supplement of November 20, drawing some attention to the difficulties that may arise and asking whether it might not be a better investment, from the point of view of money and effort, to concentrate on the development of closed circuit television, which certainly solves the problem of peak hours and also makes it easier to give this extra guidance and the follow-through which is important. The writer also goes on to suggest that there is further advantage in trying to develop a cheap and efficient way of producing, Video-tapes which would then be easily available at all times, both in schools and for adult education. Much is being done in ways, old and new, in this field, and we have heard an impressive list of speakers all urging that more should be done. It is therefore with great anticipation of hearing all the good things that the Government are going to do to help adult education that we look forward to hearing from the noble Lord, Lord Bowden.

THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE (LORD BOWDEN) My Lords, I must begin, I am afraid, by disappointing you to this extent: much as we appreciate the importance of this work, much as we realise the necessity to expand it, we have not, I am afraid, formulated plans in detail. Although I hope to be able to answer some of the questions which have been propounded, it may well be that I shall have to ask your Lordships' indulgence because I do not know the answers to others. It has been, as many speakers have said, an extraordinarily interesting debate, and I had not realised how many noble Lords have themselves been personally associated with the movement of adult education at some time in their lives; some of them still are, and almost all the speakers who have preceded me this afternoon have played a not inconsiderable part in what by any standards is one of the most important parts of the whole educational system of this country. We owe a very great deal to the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill, for initiating the debate and I would thank him for the extremely interesting background he gave and the description of the work he himself had been engaged in.
I should like, if I may, to interpolate at this point a few observations about the subject as a whole, many of which are prompted by my own experience in in the field of adult education and television and other things in America. In the first place, it is important to realise that American universities when first established in 1862 by the Morrow Act accepted three obligations as being equally important. They were the teaching of undergraduates, research, and what they generally call extension work. In other words, they are prepared to equate extension—by which they mean adult education—with undergraduate teaching. This, I think, should be a lesson to all of us. They began in the first place by realising, for example, that if agriculture was to be developed it was not only important to discover how to cure, let us say, boll weevils but to make sure that all the farmers understood the technique. From that day forward the American universities have played a very important rôle in this work, and they do so to this day.
I hope that somehow or other we shall be able to slant our own educational thinking on these lines. I must frankly confess that I think it is going to be difficult to do so, but I think it is extremely important that we should attempt it. The Americans are not only conscious that adult education has always been important, but well aware of the fact that it is getting more and more important as time goes on, and this for a whole variety of reasons, most particularly, I think, because they now realise, as we realise it here too, that what I can best call the useful half life of information which a man learns at university is quite short. This is another way of saying that information is accumulating at an extraordinarily rapid rate. It has been said many times, and I think truthfully, that the amount of knowledge in the world on any subject doubles about every ten or fifteen years. Alternatively, one might say a man must be re-educated after a similar time, otherwise half the subject matter will have been invented since he was at school. For this reason, adult education having a vocational slant is bound to become more and more important.
For example, the most spectacular case is the case of medicine. At this moment in two of the medical schools which I happen to know, Harvard and John Hopkins, the number of students in residence at any moment who are at the age of 30 or 40 or 50 having some sort of refresher course in the latest advances in medicine is about twice as great as the number of students in the ordinary medical course taking a first degree in medicine. Of course we have, as we all know, very intensive development of post-graduate medical courses in all our English medical schools, but I think it must be confessed that broadly the scale of our operations is very much less than that found to be necessary in the United States. I take medicine as an extreme case. Similarly, if we come to engineering we find that the number of people in residence at most of the technical universities in term time as undergraduates is not so great as the number of residents in the normal vacation. These men are taking refresher courses. We are doing this kind of thing on a relatively small scale, but I think that we shall have to increase our efforts to a larger scale in the not-too-distant future.
I discovered that this type of education—that is to say, refresher courses; courses which bring people up to date and introduce them to the latest development in their subjects: something that is, of course, difficult to define, very hard to organise, very diffuse and very hard to come to terms with—is now thought in America to be costing about one-third of the total educational bill. This is an order of magnitude different from anything we have here, and it makes me extremely anxious to look into the matter with very great urgency in this country to find out whether these figures are misleading and how great our own effort is to-day.
It is, of course, true that we in this country have a very great deal of adult education. We have run a great many courses, for example, in modern techniques in engineering and modern techniques in medicine. Many of these, as your Lordships know, are the responsibility of the Ministry of Education. But some are not. Some are organised by firms; some are organised by universities on their own; some done by people who club together and enjoy themselves. Precisely the same sort of thing happens everywhere. It is for this reason that reliable statistics are so hard to come by. I believe that this branch of the educational world, which in the United States, at least, is the most rapidly growing part of the whole, and already comparable in cost with any other part of it, is an aspect of the educational system which we must study very intensively. All I can tell your Lordships at this moment is that we are doing what we can to come to grips with it.
Several noble Lords have referred to the fact that there are at this moment schools of business to which people come in middle life and change the mainstream of their endeavour. These schools are, indeed, most important. I like to think of them as a very effective part of the adult education system, because not only do many of the people who come to them tend to be in their s or s, but quite often the people who engage in research are, similarly, elderly, or at least middle-aged.
I mentioned in this House, on the last occasion on which I addressed it, that we have been doing son- e work in Manchester on organisation of hospitals. I had the privilege of presenting for her doctorate a lady who has done a great deal of work and on the same day presenting her daughter and son-in-law for Bachelors degrees. It brought very much to mind the though that here in this lady, who had been educated years ago and forgotten everything she knew, was immense potential for further development, and her work was good. One must never underestimate the number of people in middle lire who are capable of educating themselves as they never had the opportunity of doing before.
We speak rather proudly of the growth of our universities; but it is important to remember that the people in middle age at this moment in this country went through the university system, or passed by the university system, at a time when the chance of education in it was perhaps 1 in 50 or so—it is perhaps now 1 in 20, or thereabouts. So many people were debarred from university education, by lack of space as much as anything, that there is no doubt at all of the immense potential in the population in middle life for further education, both pedactic and also in the field of research.
I think, too, that one may underestimate the fact that people who have lived a fairly full life, particularly, as noble Lords have said, women who have successfully brought up a family, are probably better equipped to engage in social work than younger people fresh from school who have matriculated more recently and are, perhaps, more familiar with the academic tests so frequently imposed by universities. I think it is also fair to say that our universities have sometimes been a little slow to appreciate the potential contribution which one can expect from people who, having lived their lives, are aware of the problems of social workers. I think, in fact, that not only in matters of vocational education, but also in matters of cultural education and in re-education we have to expect that the future will prove to demand developments such as have hardly been envisaged as yet.
I began just now by referring to the necessity for refresher courses in medicine and in engineering. I think one might go down to the other extreme and refer to the further education of workmen. As I have said to this House previously, workmen need to be educated many times in the course of their lifetime in order to cope with the changes in technique, in modern engineering, in modern science and in modern technology. As I said then, and I repeat, many of these problems are under active study, and particularly they pose considerable problems for the trade unions. But I think that those who are negotiating may be encouraged to know that this very afternoon, I believe for the first time in their long and distinguished history, the Inns of Court have called to the Bar men who are themselves qualified as practising accountants, and are now able, for the first time, to have dual qualification. If the Law is capable of moving in this way, perhaps the trade unions will find it less difficult than they had thought.
Now there are some remarks which have been made in the course of the debate this afternoon to which I should like briefly to refer. I was impressed by Lord Greenhill's remarks about the number of people who have themselves been active in teaching. My own contacts with the adult educational world have tended to be rather on the side of knowing people who have been taught. I like to remember, for example, the editor of the Guardian. Mr. Wadsworth, who was one of the distinguished products of the W.E.A., and I believe that as a youth he was one of the protégés of Archbishop Temple. I like to remember, too, that the present Vice-Chancellor of Manchester University left school on his fourteenth birthday, which was on the Thursday, and started work on the following Monday as a boy in an office. He was able to bring himself out of it by means of the W.E.A., went to Ruskin, read for the Bar and is now, as I say, the Vice-Chancellor of the University. I should like to think of people, of whom there are many, who owe their whole lives and their whole position. everything they are, to the opportunities which were given to them late in life by this quite extraordinary system of ours which we have been discussing this afternoon.
The noble Lord, Lord Greenhill, referred to the problems which were besetting the Newbattle Abbey College extension, with which he has had such a lot to do. I should like to assure him that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Scotland fully supports the ambitions of himself and of the College and hopes to co-operate with the Governors in ensuring that the new extension will meet the needs of the College in modern accommodation, so that it will be able to carry on its important work.
I should like now to refer briefly to the general problems of finance, and in order that I may be sure of getting this matter right, I will refer to my note. First of all, I would say that the Robbins Committee strongly supported the claims of higher education, even if they did so only to the extent of three to four pages. Therefore it was the more regrettable that the last Government found themselves unable to extend their grants for activities in 1964–65 beyond those which had been achieved in 1963–64. This came as something of a blow to the responsible bodies, and we in this Government greatly hope now to see a continued development of adult education, along with the rest of the education service.
We are at this moment reviewing the building proposals of the residential colleges, and some expansion is also programmed for next year: starting dates are now under consideration. We also believe strongly that the frustration which was produced by some of the cuts last year was most unfortunate and regrettable, because it is clear that if adult education is to be developed in an orderly way the responsible bodies must be able to plan their future appointments of staff for a reasonable period ahead, and my right honourable friend the Secretary of State has this particular matter under consideration at the present moment.
I should like to refer to the most remarkable maiden speech which was made By the noble Lord, Lord Hill of Luton, whom I think we all still think of, slightly misplaced in this House, as "the Radio Doctor" and who somehow seems to have escaped—I hope he will forgive me for saying this. We all knew him so well at one time, and it is impossible to think of him in anything other than his first guise. Now he comes, as it were, mysteriously associated with the I.T.V. We are extremely pleased to see him, and I congratulate him on his most careful speech, which outlined so clearly for us the problems which confront anyone who is trying to associate television as part of an omnibus service. As he rightly said, there is no doubt that television of itself is insufficient; but television combined with other things, will make it possible to produce an educational machine of immense importance, immense potential, and probably unlimited in its ultimate effect.
Here again, we in this country sadly lag behind the achievements of certain other countries, most notably America, where, as your Lordships know, there have been sunrise seminars for many years, and where it has been a source of great joy, as Lord Francis-Williams said, that lectures which were televised and ordinarily intended for a university audience have attracted the exceptional and enthusiastic support of people whom one might have thought incapable of understanding them, but who often have proved to he their most trenchant critics and the most critical of all the audiences available. The potential that television offers us is unlimited, but I feel strongly that its organisation as part of a system will be difficult and complex, and, I am afraid, may take some time. But we do have the example of the Americans before us, and many of them believe that if a programme which starts late at night in New York attracts a few thousand it is still worth putting out. They know that the Bing Crosby show will attract millions where this attracts hundreds. But they also realise that, small though the audience may be, it is much larger than can possibly be achieved from any ordinary university machinery in which people have to go to classrooms.
Furthermore, they have found by experience that the problem which the noble Lord, Lord Aberdare, mentioned about the difficulty of adults' having to get their children's permission to listen to the radio in the evening in the peak hours can be got over if the parents have to rise at the unearthly hour of six o'clock in the morning. This seems to be almost as good as having two sets in every bathroom. The contributions which can be made by the B.B.C. and the I.T.V will, I am sure, be made with a real sense of social purpose if the noble Lord, Lord Hill of Luton, is able, as I hope he will be able, to devote himself to this for some time to come.
Several noble Lords have referred to the correspondence courses which have been run by Professor Wiltshire in Nottingham, and also by the I.T.V. in East Anglia, when many people participated in a quite extraordinarily interesting experiment. Beyond doubt it showed that a combination of television correspondence courses and perhaps closed circuit television, which is already used, has an almost unlimited potential. I believe it is important to make the observation that the demand for education at this moment in all spheres of the system is so intense and so insatiable that, unless we are able to exploit modern techniques, we shall never be able to satisfy it. The demand is created by technology and in large measure technology will meet it. I do not believe that one can even cope with the problems of the schools, unless something very remarkable happens, without the use of artificial aids of all kinds. It is essential that we realise that this is a perfectly proper process of applying modern methods to an ancient problem.
The noble Baroness, Lady Elliot of Harwood, referred to the importance of using television as a method for aiding consumer choice; and she may or may not know that next Saturday Keele University is running a one-day course, which is called "Deciding and Choosing" and which includes a session on consumer choice and the assessment of value. This is the kind of thing which is being done in the university for consumers—and apparently the total cost is s. d.; which includes lunch. So surely no potential consumer will be deterred from attending the course, except by the problem of distance. Beyond doubt adult education for consumers is important. Yet again it is true to say that the problems of choice are made difficult because of the inevitable ignorance of the ordinary members of the public of the niceties which determine the difference between the good and the not-so-good in highly specialised articles of commerce. This is a difficulty which did not beset our grandmothers, who could tell the difference between a good cloth and an indifferent cloth by the feel of it. You cannot do that any more. The problems are extremely vexatious, and the public need; to be protected and helped in its choice. Clearly, the problem posed by the advance of technology will have to be solved, as are many others, by the same technique which brought it about. Furthermore, adult education in this field will obviously be important so long as the housewife has the spending of the family budget. This, think, will be longer than most Members of this House are likely to be interested in the problem.
My noble friend Lord Charley, whom I was very glad to hear speak in his capacity as Chairman of the Association of University Teachers, very properly pointed out how important education is after the end of an ordinary university course. This is the point I was trying to make myself. I think that, beyond doubt, the Danes pioneered it, but other countries, too, most notably America, have developed the system. It is worth remarking that the original drive for the development of the mechanics institutes, as long ago as 1824, came about because of a craving on the part of ordinary men for the opportunity to learn about the scientific principles which underlay the crafts which they practised. This is one of the least appreciated and least sung stories in the whole educational world.
There was a distinguished American visitor who came to England at about the turn of the century, and, after inspecting the entire English education system, he remarked quite firmly that there were only two English academic institutions in which he was interested and which he thought really notable. One was the system of the great public schools; the other was the system of night schools where technical education was possible. He felt that these were far more remarkable in those days (this was sixty or seventy years ago) than anything that our English universities had to offer. So let us not underestimate the contribution which has been made to adult education for many a year by such institutes as were founded in Birkbeck, in Glasgow, and in various other places 140 years ago.
Lady Gaitskell's indictment of the educational system is one with which I find myself very much in agreement. But, of course, as we have been reminded, our problems are those of priorities, and the general sense that more needs to be done is very strongly with all of us. I was particularly interested to hear of the contribution which her husband made to the W.E.A. movement, and one can fairly say that he, like many another man, found that he gained as much as he gave to this remarkable movement.
My noble friend Lord Geddes of Epsom remarked that the B.B.C. and the I.T.A. should set up study groups to explore the service which an adult education can provide. I dare say that he and other noble Lords may already know that both the B.B.C. and the I.T.A. have already set up for their adult educational work advisory councils which are fully representative of those individuals and bodies who are expert in the subject; and I am sure that both these councils will take a note of the noble Lord's suggestion, as I myself have done.
Lord Francis-Williams's most impassioned speech impressed me very much. He, too, seemed aware of the importance of adult education for half a dozen different reasons. It provides opportunities for people to be educated for the first time; to learn something about the extraordinarily interesting world, which may have passed them by in their youth. It provides opportunities for them to refresh themselves and learn more about their speciality; and it provides, most emphatically, an opportunity for people to educate themselves for the th century in which they have to live. I can assure noble Lords that the Government are looking at it, as vigorously and as earnestly as we can. Furthermore, his observation that the local needs should be appreciated is acceptable to everybody. It has always been both the glory, and in many ways the greatest trial, of the English educational system that so much is left to the free wishes of local people who will never subject themselves freely to domination from Whitehall—and long may this happy state continue!
That something must be done to study, and perhaps to improve, the correspondence course colleges is clearly necessary. We have the matter under advisement, but I am afraid that we have not as yet got far with it. Your Lordships may remember that a couple of years ago a Bill was introduced in another place by Mr. Boyden. This was talked out, but it is a matter about which we are concerned; and it is anomalous, to say the least, that correspondence colleges should be the last bastion of private enterprise in the educational world. They have done extraordinarily good work, and I think they could do more. Furthermore, I think that they could learn with great advantage from the tremendous successes that have been achieved by other correspondence courses, particularly in America.
I was impressed (and I am afraid that I did not know this fact) by the observations of the noble Lord, Lord Geddes of Epsom, about the immense investment that trade unions are making in adult education. They, too, obviously understand how important it is for everyone to be up to date and capable of appreciating the world around him; and capable, furthermore, of understanding his job sufficiently well to be able to make an effective contribution himself.
I thought the summary of the statistics by the noble Lord, Lord Aberdare, was very useful, and it is clear that we have—or, shall I say, the educational movement has—very good friends on that side of the House, as well as on this. It would, I think, be quite misleading to give the impression that it is only the Labour movement that has benefited from the W.E.A. It is perhaps true to say that more members of this Party have had no other opportunities than those provided by the W.E.A., but it seems that it has been an instrument of enlightenment, rather than an instrument for the production of members of this particular organisation of ours.
My Lords, I began by saying that this has been an extremely interesting debate. I should like to repeat that we are exceedingly grateful, not only to Lord Greenhill but to other Members of the House, who have told us, as no one else could have done, their own interests and their own experience, and the sense that they have had of participation in a very informal, a very important, and a very much misunderstood part of the educational machine. I said that in other countries the subject is taken at least as seriously as we take it, and I have also said, and will repeat, that in some countries, most notably in America, adult education is the most rapidly growing part of the whole educational machine. Whether it will be true to say again, as it so often is, that in this country we follow behind America perhaps twenty years afterwards, remains to be seen. All I would say is that we, on this side of the House, and the Government, are extremely well aware of the importance of adult education. We realise that it is going to affect all our to-morrows; it is going to have a profound influence on every member of society, and there can be no subject to which the Government are giving more anxious attention.
LORD PEDDLE My Lords, before my noble friend resumes his seat, may I seek some elucidation of one of the points he made? He made reference—and I am sure the House was glad to hear it—to the fact that it is the intention of the Government to give assistance to building programmes of residential colleges. But building programmes are not confined solely to residential colleges. I am reminded that the Minister in the last Government in August, 1963, said that owing to overriding needs the Government could not place adult educational projects in the major building plans for 1964–65. May I take it from the words of my noble friend that the Government's estimate of assistance to building projects will not be confined exclusively to residential colleges, but will extend to the many other plans that were presented to the last Government but rejected? Am I to take it that there is a reversal of the previous policy?
LORD BOWDEN My Lords, I must, of course, be extremely careful here. I can simply tell my noble friend that the matter is being looked at again, and if he would care to give me notice of the question I should be very happy to consult with my right honourable friend and define the matter precisely. All I can say is that the matter is under consideration, and I have little doubt that, say, in the spring, or at some time around then, we shall be in a better posit ion than we now are to give a definite answer. But I will take the matter under consideration and let my noble friend have a written reply.
BARONESS SUMMERSKILL My Lords, may I ask the noble Lord a question on a subject which has aroused my interest on behalf of the doctors? He rather emphasised the fact—I thought he was rather critical—that whereas in America many doctors were able to have a post-graduate course, in this country the position was really deplorable. May I ask him to interest himself in this matter, particularly because in this country the poor overworked doctor simply cannot have a locum? However much the doctor would like to do what the noble Lord suggests, he simply has no leisure, and his resources are so limited in these days that he just cannot pay for a very expensive locum. If the noble Lord could apply himself to that matter, it would repay the sick people of this country tremendously.
LORD BOWDEN My Lords, again this is not a matter on which I can speak on behalf of my right honourable friend the Minister of Health, whose responsibility this is, but I will bring it to his attention and I will see what can be done. Refresher courses for professional people in all the disciplines with which we are concerned are, I think, extremely important. I tried to make this point as strongly as I could. I was informed when I was in America recently that they have now reached a point at which promotion of their ordinary teachers is not normally given unless they have taken a certain number of refresher courses. This puts the whole matter in quite a different context, and we shall have to see how far we are able to help in this and in other matters.

LORD GREENHILL My Lords, it is not my intention to prolong the debate. My purpose in rising is simply to convey my thanks to all those who have contributed to make this debate so extremely interesting and informative. If I may, without creating any invidious distinctions, I should like in particular, first of all, to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Hill of Luton, on his excellent maiden speech and on the views he expressed in the course of that speech, which give us who are interested in adult education even greater hope than we had.
Secondly, I should like to refer to the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Elliot of Harwood, about the contribution that the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust made when Newbattle Abbey was originally established. She will probably know quite well that the then Chairman, the Earl of Elgin and Kincardine, is and has been from the very commencement of Newbattle the Chairman of Governors, and that he and another man and myself are the three surviving founder members of Newbattle Abbey College. So I would ask the noble Baroness, if I may, to put in a good word now and again, even for a contribution towards the building fund appeal, which we are now, as your Lordships know, in the process of launching. Although we are not asking for money, I think as a gesture that it would be extremely welcome.
I should also like to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Aberdare, on his virginal appearance at the Box, and without any political implications to say I hope he rises in the esteem of his own side to go to greater heights still. I well remember his 1960 intervention in the debate on adult education we had then. I well remember, also, his, if I may say so, enlightened references to the part that the B.B.C. could play in the advance of adult education. I thought his speech extremely impressive, and I see by his contribution this evening that he has not lost his old fervour. I wish him every success.
Finally, may I say in regard to the noble Lord, Lord Bowden, how delighted I am at his being in charge in your Lordships' House of education and science? Apart from his own personal achievements in his particular sphere of work, to have him here as the watchdog and, if you like, the stimulator of an interest in your Lordships' House in adult education is, I think, one of the greatest contributions that have recently been made in the furthering of education generally. I thank all of your Lordships for your part in this very important debate.
May I please repay one debt which I omitted in my somewhat incoherent original remarks? We ought, as a House, to pay our thanks to the American information service in London for their periodical known as Labour News, and particularly for the number of December, 1962, in which there is a special article headed "New Concepts of Education and Training", being the verbatim speech of W. Willard Wirtz, the United States Secretary of Labour at that time. It is an article well worth reading, and, in support of what the noble Lord, Lord Bowden, has said, it gives one an indication of the spirit in which education in the realm of labour is regarded in America.
I thank your Lordships very much for your patience. I am reminded that it is customary to withdraw my request for Papers. I confess I have not the remotest idea what those Papers are, or what they are supposed to mean; but, since it is the custom of the House to ask leave for that withdrawal, I have much pleasure in doing so.
LORD FORBES My Lords, we now fly back north of the Border. I should like to begin by apologising to your Lordships for not being present at the beginning of this debate. I would also offer my congratulations to the noble Lord, Lord Hughes, on his ministerial appointment, and wish him the best of luck at the Scottish Office.
I think that I first met the noble Lord at the Scottish Office, when we were discussing the question of the Tay Bridge. At that time, the noble Lord was Lord Provost of Dundee. Probably we can both claim that, as we did not disagree on that occasion, that is one of the reasons why the Tay Bridge is being built to-day. Later, I knew the noble Lord as the extremely successful chairman of one of Scotland's New Towns, Glenrothes. I may say that the noble Lord held both of these offices with distinction, aided, no doubt, by the fact that he was working under a Conservative Government. Of one thing I am certain, from my own experience at the Scottish Office; that is, that nowhere is any Minister likely to get more loyal service from the whole staff, whether it be the Permanent Under-Secretary of State, the private secretaries, those who operate the lifts or who drive the official cars, than the noble Lord will find at the Scottish Office.
Before going on 10 the main topic of the debate, I should just like to support what I gather my noble friend Lord Craigton said about the retrograde step the Prime Minister is taking by not appointing a Minister of State who can answer at St. Andrew's House for the Secretary of State. As a former Minister of State, I know perfectly well that an Under-Secretary of state, however astute, if he has departmental responsibilities, cannot possibly lock after his Department and see all the papers that the Secretary of State sees. This means that from now on all decisions, except departmental ones, which are the responsibility of the noble Lord, Lord Hughes, will have to be dealt with from Whitehall. Furthermore, Scotsmen, whether individuals or members of delegations, will have to travel to London to get their answers. I ask the Government: Is this the way to treat the people of Scotland? Do they seriously think that the people of Scotland wish the clock to be put back to the time when practically all the decisions affecting Scotland came from Whitehall?
Scotland is not in any way a sick country: on the contrary, she is a country full of opportunities. However, Scotland has the misfortune of having been almost entirely dependent on heavy industry. This situation is being put right but, of course, it is a slow job. What is it that Scotland needs most? Surely, the answer is, more new jobs. And there is little doubt that most new jobs come from industrial growth. There is no doubt at all that, if we are to get industrial growth, good communication for personnel travel and freight movement are essential. I shall therefore attempt to convince those of your Lordships who are not already convinced of the necessity for good communications, and I shall deal with railways, roads and, especially, the air.
First of all, I take rail transport. It is ridiculous to say that awkward loads must go by rail. The railways, due to such factors as gauge and tunnel size, are less able than the roads to deal with these awkward loads. However, what is wanted is that many more complete loads should go by rail. Much more traffic, in the form of complete loads, would go by rail if it were not for the fact that double handling is often involved. To overcome this objection more loads must be moved by containers. The speed-up of what British Railways call "containerisation" is urgently required on the railways. I made my maiden speech in this House some ten years ago on the subject of "containerisation." I admit that the railways are now moving in the right direction over this matter, but up till recently the wheels have been turning lamentably slowly. It is not just a question of making containers available: the railways have also to make the container rates attractive, if they are to attract more traffic which should be on the railways but is at present cluttering up the roads.
I come to the roads. There is no doubt that the roads provide the conveyor system for industry and in doing so, can provide a means of moving goods without double handling. They also provide door-to-door communications for personnel. To the industrialist it is becoming more and more obvious that the most important requirement of our road system is the development of trunk roads, with a minimum standard of dual-carriageway, rather than classified county roads, many of which are very much better in Scotland than those found South of the Border. Surely the trunk roads are the arteries of any road system while the classified roads are the veins. We all know that it is no use having the veins in excellent conditions, if the arteries are blocked. It seems to me that some of our priorities have not been quite right.
What are some of the urgent specific requirements? First, a dual-carriageway road from Aberdeen, via Dundee and the Tay and Forth Bridges, to England. Of course, the most important part of this project is the link between the Tay and Forth Bridges; and this should also serve Glenrothes, one of our New Towns, which would thrive even better if communications were improved. Then I turn to something for which the noble Lord, Lord Ferrier, has been pressing—a proper by-pass around Edinburgh, instead of a so-called ring route, which is nothing more than a multitudinous collection of signs. It is no use the Government talking about a traffic census. Now that the Forth Bridge is open, the extra traffic through Edinburgh is becoming unbearable. It can be seen any day. There is no need to wait until the mass of statistics is completed and examined before action is taken: the facts are there to be seen.
In the air, if Scotland is to get ahead and so bring about the essential industrial growth, we must assure that air communications and personal travel are further developed. I cannot emphasise too strongly that we cannot live and complete in this space age when a distance barrier still exists in the United Kingdom. The distance barrier between Scotland and the South-East of England or the Midlands cannot be tolerated one day longer. The growth in the South-East of England and the Midlands is still dominant. There, industry thrives; there, new jobs are to be found in abundance. There is the industrial magnet which would draw most of industry, were it not for the necessary action of Governments who have had to use the stick in these areas while holding out a carrot in others. It is in the South-East of England and in the Midlands that industry is really thriving. It is there that the 'sixties competitive industrial "bug", which can be so contagious, is caught, just as much as the plague was in days gone by. Scotland must be given the necessary air facilities to break the distance barrier and enable Scottish industrialists to travel and catch this competitive industrial "bug."
Command Paper 2188, A Programme for the Development of Central Scotland, published in 1963, made, in paragraph 66, this observation about air communications: Good air communications for both domestic and international journeys have become an essential part of any modern expanding economy. Businessmen need to be in the closest touch with their markets and be able quickly to follow up any new opportunities wherever they may be. The availability of an airport within reasonable travelling distance offering both domestic services and either direct international flights or convenient connections thereto is increasingly important in attracting new industrial commercial enterprises. Then, in 1964, there was published another White Paper, Cmnd. 2440, and I should like to quote just a part of paragraph 73: Discussions have taken place with the Scottish Council (Development and Industry) about their Master Plan for improving air services. I must ask the Government what has happened to the Scottish Council's "Master Plan" for improving air services. It has been in existence for a very long time—certainly, quite long enough for the decisions to be made. Somebody must be "soft-pedalling" and not only Members of this House but also the whole of Scotland should know who it is. I would ask the noble Lord, Lord Hughes, the question: Who is "soft-pedalling"?
Personal meetings between directors and executives are essential if new contracts leading to new jobs are to be created. The telephone and letters have their use, but for real progress personal meeting is usually essential. Here do not let us forget the value of the executive's time, and that absence of frustration is essential. This is where the air can play such an important rôle. We must also remember that once goods have been produced they have to be sold; and for this purpose salesmen, too, must be able to move about easily.
Let me now turn to a few specific cases. Before choosing a site industrialists usually look carefully at communications. This applies even more to those who are coming from the other side of the Atlantic. Americans and Canadians know full well the merits of Scottish workers, but this does not override their insistence on good communications. I experienced an example of this when an American firm was on the point of setting up in Dundee, but cried off owing to lack of air communications. Then at Edinburgh a second runway is badly needed, so that aircraft can land in what are at present cross-winds. Flying down two evenings ago I got to Edinburgh, where I was told that the plane coming up from London could not get into Edinburgh. We had to go by bus to Renfrew, and come on that way, which involved a delay of three hours. Edinburgh is Scotland's capital city, and it is ridiculous that a capital city should have only one runway. Of course, we all know that a second runway will cost money, but this is money that will have to be found. In my part of the country, the North-East, we must have a service from Aberdeen, Glasgow and the Midlands. One can get to Edinburgh and to London quite easily, but Glasgow and the Midlands are very difficult to get to.
Then there is the question of executive aircraft. We must not forget the important rôle played by executive aircraft to-day in saving both time and frustration. I am a director of two brewing companies. Our parent company has an executive plane which enables the company to carry on business not only throughout the United Kingdom but also abroad. Unfortunately, the facilities afforded to executive plane operators are far from adequate. Understandably, executive aircraft can only on occasions use London Airport. Other civil airports can be used, but often use has to be made of R.A.F. airfields. Unfortunately, the R.A.F. stop work for the day at 5 o'clock, and sometimes earlier. This early hour beyond which facilities are not available cramps the style of the executive, who usually has great difficulty in planning his business so as to land before 5 p.m. In addition, the V.H.F. frequency at present used by executive aircraft is very overcrowded. Another point is that they should be able to obtain Customs facilities on giving prior warning at master airfields when landing executive aircraft returning from abroad. If executive flying is to be developed, these matters must be put right.
As I have said, Scotland is not ill, but if she is to get sufficient industrial growth, and consequent new jobs, within the foreseeable future she will do well to get a shot in the arm. What better way to do this than by ensuring that Scotland has not just good air communications, or as good as those of other countries, but better than other countries? And in planning the best air communications for businessmen, do not let us forget that the businessman can seldom book ahead. He must be able to travel when he wants to. That means virtually a "walk-on, walk-off" air service.
Most airlines are unwilling to put on a service until there are signs that the existing services are becoming overcrowded. It cannot be too strongly emphasised, however, that the potential cannot be assessed until a new or an increased air service has been tried. This may mean that new services will require some Government help in order to keep them going. In this respect I would emphasise two things: First, that any Government help, if required, should be confined to starting off these new services; and, secondly, Government assistance must be available to any (and I stress "any") suitable air contractor. There is little doubt that any grant or loan the Government might have to give to ensure that Scotland has one of the best air services in the world would be a mere flea-bite compared with, say, the recent losses which have been chalked up by British Railways.
My Lords, Scotland is on the brink of breaking the distance barrier. In 1963, 18 per cent. more people travelled by air in Scotland than in the previous year. Surely, it is up to everyone, not only the Government, to see that as from 1965 the distance barrier becomes a thing of the past. The Government and everyone having Scotland at heart have a great opportunity to recognise that good communications, especially air communications, are essential to produce the economic growth which is necessary before we can get employment growth. This is an important lever which the Government can use to prise open the opportunities that exist throughout Scotland. If the Government do not at once give the green light, the "go-ahead", to Scottish air services and better facilities for executive aircraft, then I warn your Lordships that, like the Ministry of Transport television advertisement which refers to the "boot-bumper" driver, the driver who is always on the tail of the car in front, I shall be a "boot-bumper" driver to the Government. I shall continually drive on their heels. But I sincerely hone that the need for improved air services will be recognised so that this painful action is not necessary.

THE EARL OF DUNDEE My Lords, this is not a Party Motion, and I should like to make a few short remarks about it, not on behalf of the Opposition, but as an individual Peer of Scotland. First, may I offer my very warm congratulations to the noble Lord, Lord Hughes—who this evening will make his maiden speech from the Front Bench—on his appointment to an office which we all wish had been higher. While I quite agree with my noble friend Lord Craigton that it is not a good thing for Scotland that the Minister who answers for Scotland in your Lordships' House should not be the Minister of State, I do not think anybody could blame Lord Hughes for this negative state of affairs. We know that he is a modest man, but we do not suspect that his modesty might have been carried to such extreme lengths as to insist on being appointed to a lower office than everybody else thinks he ought to have.
Our purpose in discussing this Motion is not to criticise the noble Lord, but to help him in the work which he has been called upon to do. We hope that he may be able to wind up this debate with the words of King Edward in Richard III: Why, so: now have I done a good day's work; You peers, continue this united league". That, of course, was an English league and not a Scottish one. The Scottish league is sometimes more solemn and perhaps more effectual.
As it happens, the office to which the noble Lord has just been appointed is the same office to which I was appointed just over 28 years ago in October, 1936. I do not know whether the noble Lord has the same room as I had. I rather hope he has, because it is by far the loveliest ministerial room in Whitehall. But even if the pressure of modern ministerial overcrowding has pushed the noble Lord into one of the attics of Dover House, we are glad that this debate should he answered by a Minister who, before he came into office, did a lot more to promote the aims of this Motion than any of his innumerable colleagues in the Government that I can think of. Besides being Chairman of the Development Corporation of the New Town at Glenrothes, and besides having been Lord Provost of Dundee for six years, the noble Lord was also Chairman of the Joint Tay Road Bridge Committee, a post which required considerable tact and skill. I would assure your Lordships that many of the people he had to deal with were far more difficult than my noble friend Lord Forbes. I think it is generally agreed that the noble Lord's chairmanship of this Tay Road Bridge Committee did a great deal to accelerate the commencement of that long desired project, which is now more than half way towards completion.
Perhaps some of your Lordships may not be aware that, unlike the Forth Road Bridge, which was opened just over two months ago—it seems much longer than that now, but quite a lot of things have happened since then—the Tay Road Bridge does not receive any Government grant at all. The whole of the £4½ million which is now being spent on its construction is provided by the three local authorities of Dundee, Fife and Angus. Dundee contributes 63 per cent., Fife 27 per cent., and Angus 10 per cent. I have always thought, and I still think, that, when it comes into use, the transport authorities at St. Andrew's House will find that they have underestimated the quantity of long distance traffic which will use this bridge. But however that may be, the bridge is certainly an essential part of what the White Paper calls the infrastructure for the economic growth of Scotland. I hope that the volume of traffic which will use it will be enough to enable the three local authorities who have put up the money to reimburse themselves from the toll charges for their outlay—at least the greater part of their outlay. If they could get the whole of their outlay back, it would be a most gratifying success story, and we should not grudge paying the tolls which will be only a small fraction of the present ferry charges.
There is one other matter concerning East Central Scotland which I must raise, and which I think ought to be raised in this debate. I will not press the noble Lord for a reply, because I know that he has the right ideas on the subject, and I think it is only fair to give him a little more time. There are two recent White Papers dealing with the development and growth in Scotland. First, Cmnd. 2188, Central Scotland, which was published last November and then Cmnd. 2440, Development and Growth in Scotland, 1963–64, published only two months ago in September. In paragraph 19 of the first of these two White Papers a summary is given of measures which are proposed to he taken for the Scottish economy. Under the heading "Airports" are summarised the completion of Abbotsinch airport, the preparation of plans for the development of Turn-house, and the urgent consideration of the needs of Dundee. Again, Dundee has a little paragraph, No. 69, all to itself: Dundee's need for regular air communications to the industrial and commercial centres in the south is, along with airfield requirements for the area, now being urgently considered. That was 12 months ago when it was being "urgently considered".
In the other White Paper, published in September, paragraphs 74 and 75, on pages 16 and 17, describe the progress which has been made in improving the aerodrome and navigational facilities in Scotland. It is mentioned that the amount of money invested in those improvements has gone up from £643,000 in 1962–63 to £1,853,000 in 1963–64. But the only mention of Dundee is: At Dundee the Corporation have lengthened the landing strip at Riverside Park to 4,500 feet and a licence has been granted to Messrs. Duncan Logan Ltd., to operate a passenger service between Dundee and Edinburgh using four and five seater aircraft. That, of course, is a charter service which does not run regularly and, indeed, does not run at all unless someone charters it for a special flight. I do not think that is very abundant fruit for 12 months' "urgent consideration" which we were told was being given to the matter in November 1963. What we want is a regular service. Of course, the licence for a chartered aeroplane is not a regular service, and although they do not mention it, I think I know the cost which the Corporation have lately incurred in lengthening Riverside Park; it was £13,000. That is £13,000 out of a total of very nearly £2 million which has been spent in Scotland. I think we are entitled to ask that the "urgent consideration" should be speeded up a little.
We would certainly like a regular feeder service from Dundee either to Turnhouse or to Renfrew. Better still, would be a through-service to London such as they have from Aberdeen. I am fully aware, and I am sure the noble Lord, Lord Hughes, is, too, of the various difficulties. At the present moment, for reasons we need not go into, the use of Leuchars military aerodrome seems to be not practicable; and as for the Dundee airstrip, B.E.A. have always claimed that a feeder service would cost them an annual loss of something like £40,000. I do not know that they have ever given a sufficient allowance for what they would get back by the extra passengers they would gain for their long-distance flights to London.
I have said that I am not going to press the noble Lord for an answer to this to-night, but there seem to be two things which could be done. One would be to allow free competition the whole way to London from private airlines. I do not think you can expect a private airline to undertake the unprofitable haul of the short feeder service from Dundee to Renfrew unless it were allowed to go on and take passengers to London. Either you should have free competition or the Government should instruct B.E.A. to run the feeder service and should then consult with them as to the amount of money which they could reasonably be expected to lose in one year. They say they will not do it without a subsidy. Very well, let us see how much it would cost. I think that is a matter which should be urgently considered, as the White Paper said was being done.
The primary reason why we want it done is not for anybody's private convenience but for the reason which I do not think could be stated better than it is in the White Paper itself (paragraph 66), which says: Good air communications for both domestic and international journeys have become an essential part of any modern expanding economy. Business men need to be in the closest touch with their market and to be able quickly to follow up any new opportunities, wherever they may be. The availability of an airport within reasonable travelling distance. offering both domestic services and either direct international flights or convenient connections thereto, is increasingly important in attracting new industrial and commercial enterprises. That, my Lords, is the main point, its importance, "in attracting new industrial and commercial enterprises".
It is very true that good air services are becoming an increasingly important necessity for all the development areas. Dundee is rather on the periphery of the central industrial belt. It is, of course, a "development area." It is not what is termed a "growth area", and I am not going to discuss whether or not it ought to be a growth area. What I am concerned about is, that in the Government's regional planning and in their economic planning Dundee should not be left out. It is certainly in the national interest that it should not be left out, because, except for Glasgow, Dundee has a higher industrial production than any other city in Scotland, and a great many of its products are particularly important to our export trade. Therefore, it is in the national interest that those who plan the infrastructure of our economic growth should see that there are good communications by air, by rail and by road, and, also, my Lords, by sea, because Dundee has the best port in Eastern Scotland with deep water wharves which can take larger ships than any other port in East Scotland.
I would ask the Government to make representations to the National Ports Council about the future of Dundee Harbour. It would be a great pity if it were to be let down in any way, if the plan for port facilities for East Scotland did not enable Dundee to play its full part in any scheme which the National Ports Council may produce. It would not be right, and would not be in the public interest, if other ports were to be modernised by Government subsidies so that they could greatly reduce their port charges and the Port of Dundee could no longer make its charges competitive.
As it is with the infrastructure of the economy, so it is also with industrial planning. It is in the national interest that the modernisation of the jute industry—which is bound to employ less people as it becomes more specialised, like other textile industries—should be balanced by a greater diversity of factories.
LORD ROBERTSON OF OAKRIDGE My Lords, I wonder if the noble Lord would allow me to interrupt and to hark back to a moment or two ago when he was talking about the air service and, in particular, to the desirability of the Government making a subvention to B.E.A. if necessary in order to run a feeder service? Could he say why, if this service is so important to industry, industry is not prepared to pay for it? Alternatively, if B.E.A. are to be given a subvention to run it, would the noble Lord also suggest that British Railways should be given a subvention to help them in their competition with B.E.A. on this service?
THE EARL OF DUNDEE British Railways, as I understand it, are already costing us £150 million a year, which I would call a pretty hefty subvention. The Government do, of course, give a subsidy to B.E.A. for certain purposes, and whether local interests would be able to do what they have done in the case of the Tay Bridge I do not know. But I should have thought the Government ought to look into the matter with B.E.A. and try to work out how much they would need to run this feeder service, at least as a first step.
I now come on to the need for a better balance of industry in Dundee, the need for modernisation of the jute industry to be balanced by greater diversity of new factories. It is necessary that the very excellent new industries, both from Britain and from America, which have come to Dundee in the last seventeen years should be extended a good deal more. Dundee wit never be and does not want to be a conurbation, but we do need a considerable extension of the new industries which have come there already. I think the latest local redevelopment plan, which the noble Lord may perhaps have seen, does no: appear to contain nearly enough room for new factories. I would suggest to the noble Lord that the new factories should include one or two of the standard new Board of Trade factories which are to be provided ready for occupation to various development areas. I think it would be a good thing for the country if we were to speed up the extension of new industries in Dundee, which has not got quite so many new factories as other areas in the last few years.
I hope that the Scottish development group and all the departments associated with it will give particular attention to these three points: tie need for an air service; the need for the Port of Dundee to be properly developed, together with other ports; and the need for an acceleration of new building on or near the industrial estate. I hope that the Government and the noble Lord will see that consideration is given to these points. One reason why I am glad the noble Lord, Lord Hughes, is there. even although he is not a Minister of State, is that I think he is the type of Minister who has what one might call a dominant mind which will not be easily disposed to allow proposals which he knows to be good proposals, and in the national interest, to be checked and frustrated by what Sir Winston Churchill described as the padded cells of indubitable fact and the solid masonry of unanswerable objection. My Lords, I think that a stranger who travelled through Scotland five years ago and who travelled through Scotland again this year would notice a id would be more impressed perhaps by the changes that have taken place in the country than we are, because we who live in Scotland have been so accustomed, during those intervals when we can escape from the concentration camp at Westminster, to feel that we are fighting a long uphill battle against overwhelmingly superior odds. When I held the noble Lord's office 28 years ago one of my duties was to move the Second Reading in another place of the Special Areas Act, 1937. That was just after the Hillington Industrial Estate had been established and at the same time as the Scottish Special Housing Association was formed, and we had great hopes then of new industrial and housing programmes. Those were checked by the war.
Since the war, although we have had very great industrial progress indeed, it has nearly always been equalled, and sometimes exceeded, by loss, not only loss of employment but loss of production in old industries, and many people have developed a kind of failure complex thinking things can never improve. The Local Employment Act, 1960, which I think was a very good Act, had a bad reception in Scotland. It may be that it was not as well presented as it should have been, but it was not received with enthusiasm, although it was associated with the two great new ventures, of B.M.C., at Bathgate, and Rootes Group, at Linwood, and many other new developments.
The measures in the Budget of 1963, on the other hand, giving unprecedented advantages to new industries, did have a better reception by the Press and public, and since then the number of inquiries for new industries has certainly been very much greater. A week or two ago when I was in Edinburgh I went to Her Majesty's Stationery Office and got a copy of a deadly dull looking document called Digest of Scottish Statistic's, October, 1964, which is an official Government publication. From this horribly dull book I derived the cheerful information that in one year, from June, 1963, to June, 1964, industrial production in Scotland had gone up from 117 points to 127 points (1958 being the base year). That is an increase of more than 7½ per cent. We have still a very long way to go, but I think we have achieved a major breakthrough in the enemy's defences, and if only we can all co-operate now in exploiting our breakthrough and taking advantage of our position, and continuing the momentum of our advance, although we may have a long way to go it need not be a very long time before Central Scotland has become as progressive and as flourishing an industrial area as any other in Europe.

BARONESS HORSBRUGH My Lords, I do not intend to detain your Lordships for very long, but there are just one or two considerations I should like to put before you. When I spoke in the debate on this White Paper last December, I and many other noble Lords asked the Minister of State who was then in charge, my noble friend Lord Craigton, whether we could have progress reports. Here were outlined for us suggestions for Scotland and for the central area of Scotland, and I was anxious that we should see what progress was made. He replied that we should get the Annual Report of the Scottish Development Department, which we now have, published, I think, last September. I would thank him for that and for all the figures in it. In fact, I think it would have been hardly necessary for my noble friend Lord Dundee to get the very dull publication in Edinburgh because of the mass of information contained in this Report. We have the information; it is definite, and I thank the noble Lord for having given it to us. I also congratulate him and all those who have been working with him, on what has been done in the preparation of these two Reports.
I feel that we have now made a very good start. The difficult decision having been taken to pick out one particular region in which to put most of our efforts to begin with—and I said I thought they were right to select and concentrate first of all—I quite see now that we must go further afield. There are the difficulties of the Highlands, the Borders and various other places. But I would appeal to the present Government that when they, as we all know we must now, look for further improvements away from the central area, they will not in any way give up their interest in, their pressure for and the help to, this central part of Scotland, which, after all, has three-quarters of our population and 90 per cent. of our industry.
I hope that in leaving office my noble friend Lord Craigton realises what a good job he has done, and how much that is recognised throughout Scotland. I hope, too, that the new Ministers may follow in his footsteps. My noble friend said last time in his winding-up that there was a new hope in Scotland, that there seemed now to be some optimism. I know that we went through a stage of being rather miserable, rather depressed, perhaps giving to the world outside an idea that we were a depressed area and a depressed people. But really we were not. Nothing is so enervating to the morale and outlook of an individual, or of a community or nation, as when we become sorry for ourselves or feel that we have not had a fair deal. I think that Scotland suffered a little from that. I am glad to think that we have now got through that stage; that we now have a different outlook, that there is more hope, more energy. I think that that new outlook has been symbolised and helped this year by the opening of the Forth Road Bridge, which seemed to many of us a symbol of what we could do, and how we were travelling into the new, modern world with our energy and our technical skill, following upon the efforts that we have made in the past and can make in the future.
In the debate we had last December certain suggestions were made by various noble Lords. At that time, of course, the noble Lord, Lord Hughes, was not quite certain that he would be in the place where he is to-day, but he told us that practically certainly he would be; and I must give it to him—he was right, though I do not think there was perhaps quite that clarion call to the Labour Party from the electors that he felt was coming. But at that time he put forward an Amendment to the effect that the proposals in the White Paper failed to ensure an immediate, substantial reduction in unemployment.
I was in another place for a good many years and I have been here for but a short time, but I know quite well that when you are drafting an Amendment the language used should be rather elastic. What exactly is the meaning of "substantial"? Perhaps Lord Hughes will tell us, when he replies, whether he thinks the reduction in unemployment in Scotland in this last year has or has not been substantial. I should like to congratulate him on his appointment as a Minister. I am not entering into the controversy whether it would be better for Lord Hughes, or for us in this House, if he were a Minister of State. There are plenty of Ministers of State in other Departments, and the Government could quite easily cut down on one and hand it on to Scotland. Whether the noble Lord, Lord Hughes, would like it or not, I do not know. I am sorry he has not got it, but it does not seem to me to make so much difference.
Having said that he thought that he, or at any rate his Party, would be in authority by this time, he put forward two concrete suggestions which he urged the then Minister, my noble friend Lord Craigton, to deal with. I should like to ask Lord Hughes whether he has already dealt with those, because they were quite clear and he had made up his mind. His noble Leader here could have heard him, and I am quite sure that others will have read his speech in Hansard. There were two particular points he made. The first was in regard to the s. per ton surcharge on coal in Scotland. He told us what a difference it made in Glenrothes, and that my noble friend Lord Craigton should be pressing his colleagues to gent that matter dealt with. I should now like to ask the noble Lord, Lord Hughey, whether he has already pressed his colleagues to deal with it. He has had a year to tell them all about it, because he knew then, so he told us, that his Party was going to be in power.
The second point is one in which I am particularly interested—namely, that one or more Government Departments could move some or all of their activities to Scotland. I see that the noble Lord agrees, so perhaps that is coming about. I ask particularly for this, because there have been rumours in the last two weeks that perhaps the present Government were going to change the plans for taking the Post Office Savings Bank to Glasgow. Informed people have said that that could not be possible because, from a leaflet published by the Labour Party last year, not only was the Post Office to be concerned but so were one or more other Government Departments. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Hughes, can tell us about that.
Then, during my speech, he made an intervention, to which, naturally, I was quite pleased to sit down and listen. It was to the effect that the White Paper contained merely words and no action. Of course, White Papers generally contain words. But he did say that they were good words, that the language was very good indeed, and he admired it. He said that there was too much generalisation and that he wanted specific proposals. As I say, during my speech he intervened. I asked if we could have from him, or from any of his colleagues on those Benches, specific proposals.
This was last December. But of course that was a little too early, and we had to wait a year by which time, they prophesied quite rightly, they would be sitting where they are. But they said they had specific proposals to cure the ills of Scotland. I should be most interested to hear to-night from the noble Lord what the specific proposals are. I shall not be altogether surprised if the noble Lord says that I must not press him for that information, because, after all, the Government have been in office for only four or live weeks. They have done such a lot of mischief that I thought it was much longer
LORD CRAIGTON Forty days and nights.
BARONESS HORSBRUGH Not yet the hundred days, anyway. I should not be surprised to hear that they have not specific proposals. Although in last year's debate I was told about specific proposals to cure the ills of the Scottish economy, I did not believe they had them. I cannot press the noble Lord to-night and ask him to produce them now, when I did not think they had them then. If they had, if the specific proposals they were talking about last year had already been really thought out, of course we could have them this evening; but I doubt if they did.
In conclusion, there is one other subject to which I should like to refer—namely, the training and education of young workers who are coming into industry. I was glad to hear of the extra schools and colleges of technical education and commerce, of the training centres, and all the rest of it, because it is absolutely necessary that we have more skilled workers. That is always the difficulty. There may be unemployment, but there may not be enough skilled workers in order that one can take on less skilled workers. We need now not to get a greater short-term policy for Scotland, but a longer-term policy, to look to the future when these young people who are coming in now are going to be the mainstay of the workers in the industries of Scotland, and with more to follow them.
In these schools, training centres and colleges we hope to teach them their skills in the modern outlook and all that is otherwise required. But there is something further that we can teach them for which we are not crying out now. That is a greater sense of responsibility, a greater sense of the worth that they can bring to their country and to industry if they go about their work with keenness and enthusiasm.
One of the difficulties concerning our debates in Parliament and comment in the Press is that we are bound to spend our time pushing the Government which is in power to help us more—to give us more grants for Scotland, to provide us with more opportunities for doing this or that. I believe that some young people are growing up with the idea—and perhaps we are to blame and not they—that it is the Government which will decide whether or not Scotland is going to be prosperous. We all know that that is not the case. It is the co-operation between the Government and all the people in industry in Scotland, whether in management or on the shop floor, working together, which will decide. We shall have to tell these young people as they grow up and learn their skills that an industry cannot simply sit back and say, "The Government will arrange this or that", and no effort will need to be made by the individual. The answer lies with the people of Scotland as a whole.
In conclusion, I can assure the noble Lord, Lord Hughes, that we on this side of the House will support and help all the proposals which the new Government can put forward for the welfare of Scotland. If we think they are not for the welfare of Scotland, then we shall oppose them; and, as the noble Lord knows, I am not shy at opposing.

THE EARL OF SELKIRK My Lords, I should like to wish the noble Lord, Lord Hughes, every good fortune in the task which he has undertaken. I confess that I must endorse the regrets which have already been expressed that he was not made a Minister of State. I think this is a matter of importance, and I find it hard to believe that when the appointment was made there really existed an understanding of its significance to the Scottish Office. When the Labour Government were last in power we in Scotland were rather frightened at what the significance of centralised planning might be. At one stage it almost reached the point of running the Glasgow trams from London. That is all past, and I do not for one moment think that mistakes of that kind are going to be made again. But it is important for the noble Lord to appreciate how much we need to realise that our problems are understood.
When Scotland comes up for debate in this House it very often tends to be discussed on a purely constituency basis. This is rather a pity, and one can hear Englishmen going through the corridors saying, "Why not give them Home Rule, and they can deal with their own problems themselves?". But this is part of a very important national problem. It is an essential and integral part of what twenty-five years ago Montague Barlow called a social, economic and a strategic problem which requires immediate attention. This stretches beyond Scotland, and I make no bones about it. It applies to the North-East and to other parts of the country. It is important that the question should not be regarded simply from a constituency angle. When I was Commissioner of Special Areas of Scotland some twenty-five years ago the problem then was one of unemployment. But to-day, although that problem is with us, if we regard it simply as an unemployment problem we shall not solve it. It is a bigger, wider problem, and cannot be measured purely in terms of unemployment.
There is one other point which has constantly recurred in recent years, and I have no reason to believe that it will not recur in the future. When we get, as we probably now have in London, and as we probably have in the Midlands, over-employment, any action to relieve it, with the inevitable inflation that goes with it, intensifies industrial, economic and employment problems in Scotland, the North-East and elsewhere. This problem will continue until there is a better balance between the two areas in the country.
To give another example of this, in most conurbations there is probably what might be described as an optimum size, at our present stage of technological advance. If we go beyond that it becomes increasingly expensive to provide the public services in transport, in education, in health and so on. I do not think there is any doubt that London has already passed that stage. Any increase here will be at very great cost to the community, and any reduction will probably be a saving to the community. If I may say this to the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill, when he spoke about Glasgow he did not mention that one of the greatest things which Glasgow has done is to decide not to expand its population. This is an important decision, which very few municipalities in the world have ever taken. I should like to see a similar decision taken in London. It has not yet been taken, and it is about time London took it.
There is another problem involved. People who belong to the free trade school say, "What does it matter? You can have migration from one place to another, so why bother about it?" But migration is not the answer. The reason is that the most vigorous and adaptable people are those who migrate, and one is then inevitably left with a declining community containing the less vigorous members of the population.
LORD GREENHILL My Lords, I am sorry to interrupt the noble Earl, but I should like to say this. Some of us perhaps feel that there can be such a thing as over-population. What I should like the noble Earl to explain is what possible remedy would he suggest to overcome that problem? He knows Glasgow, and knows perfectly well that there is no line of demarcation, for example, between Glasgow and Paisley; one does not know where the population begins or ends. To take as another example an area like Knightswood, with a population as large as the population of Perth, put into an area which is far too big according to modern standards for that number of people, what is the noble Earl going to do? Is he going to pull down the houses and send away the people? We can complain about these things with justification, but what is your remedy?
THE EARL OF SELKIRK My Lords, frankly, I am not clear what the noble Lord is asking me. All I was saying was that Glasgow had taken the right decision, and an important decision. It is not extending itself, but is deliberately trying to reduce its population. I was saying that that is a very wise thing to do. I am not quite clear what the noble Lord is asking me to answer.
874
LORD GREENHILL I am sorry if my question was not clear to the noble Earl. What Glasgow is doing at the moment, so far as I understand, is two things. One is to have an overspill, at some cost to itself, and at the same time attract four, five or six thousand, as in the case of the Post Office Savings Bank population, to come into Glasgow. Which is the right course? That is what I am asking him. What is he complaining of, overspill, or underspill?
THE EARL OF SELKIRK So far as I know the position in Glasgow (and the noble Lord who was on the Glasgow Council for many years is more familiar with the position than I am), I should describe the entrance of the Post Office Savings Bank as a form of metabolism—a change in development in the structure of Glasgow, and a thoroughly healthy one. But I understand that the overall population is in fact diminishing. I think that is the right, inevitable and proper decision. It is a wise decision which few municipalities have taken, and which Glasgow is perfectly right to take. I am emphasing that, if we are going to live healthily in these islands, we must spread the economic effort over a wider basis. To-day it is too concentrated and we must try to rectify that.
My Lords, we have used, not without effect, a good deal of the carrot and the stick, but success here must be on a voluntary basis. You cannot succeed beyond a certain point by compelling people to go anywhere. It is no good putting a man in some place and locking the door and saying, "You have got to produce so much there before you can come out." There may be encouragement, but there must be a great deal of willing co-operation. Frankly, all the efforts so made have not yet reduced the tremendous lure and attraction of coming to the South-East. All that has been done in money and in refusing development certificates has not yet overcome this problem.
I must say this. I wonder just why it is that, with all the advantages of transport and communications, we still have people coming more and more into the centres—this is of course happening in Glasgow itself—and not staying outside, where communications are very much better than they were, say, fifty, let alone a hundred, years ago. If we take Scotland as an example, it is difficult to know just why it is that this does not present the attraction it might otherwise do. As has been shown in the Toothill Report, the levels of salaries and wages are just about the same as they are anywhere else. I should have thought that, compared with living in London, where the traffic chaos is probably much the same for all who live here, there must be considerable advantages in many people's minds in going outside. Indeed, if we take Scotland as an example of theatre and golf, I dare say that although the theatres are better in London, the golf is probably better in Scotland. The amenities are there. What is it that has made people reluctant to take it up?
I understand—and it may be worth going into—that less trouble has been found in this respect with American firms than with British firms. American firms have gone readily and been quite happy to develop. I am bound to say that I have reached the conclusion—and I should be glad to have it rebutted—that the reasons why people come into the South-East and do not go into the Northern part of the country are neither rational nor economic: the reasons cannot be explained on rational grounds or on economic grounds. On the other hand, in the national interest, whatever those reasons are, they must be countered.
I am only going to suggest that we should aim at the creation of a greater dynamic life, certainly in Scotland and maybe in other places in the North-East. One way this can be done is by a closer association of industry and the universities. I believe we could do more than we are doing in that sphere. A great deal more of that is done in America than is done in this country, and I believe we could make a much more definite effort to do that. What is required there is more in the way of design teams, design centres. The danger so often has been that a firm has sent to Scotland a branch production agent which is the easiest to be dispensed with. When a closure is to take place that is the first branch to close down; and what is wanted, therefore, is design teams where ideas can be developed.
Finally, perhaps the noble Lord can do something to try to counteract what certainly is a prejudice of Government Departments against going a long way from where they are situated. There is, I am sure, a certain favouritism towards firms which are more nearly placed to Government Departments. In America the expression "centres of excellence" is used. There are two or three of them where very high-grade work can be done. I believe it should be our major aim, in considering this as a national task, to make the central area of Scotland a centre of excellence.

LORD DRUMALBYN My Lords, I should like to start, as almost every other noble Lord has done, by congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Hughes, on his appointment. I personally had expected that it would be higher, and I own that I was disappointed that it was not. But at any rate I can say this: for a long time I had the pleasure, if I may put it that way, of being at the receiving end of his representations; and now the positions are reversed. That, at any rate, is a piece of justice.
May I say this to the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill? I thought that his speech showed how very difficult it is to say anything which may not be interpreted as criticism. He seemed to think that the sole function of the Opposition is to complain. Of course that is not so, least of all in a debate like this, though, obviously, we have to bring out the points that are wrong. But I did not detect anything in the speech of my noble friend Lord Craigton which was in the nature of criticism of Glasgow. What I think my noble friend did say was that the whole system of inducements to firms to move out of Glasgow, and to firms to move into Glasgow, ought to be looked into. And, with all respect, with that view I agree. I would only add that I think we should also look into the question of who is to pay the cost of the inducements.
It is of course possible to take measures that will immediately reduce unemployment, although I doubt whether it would be possible to take measures which would immediately reduce unemployment in Scotland to the general level of that in the United Kingdom. In other words, what we are faced with in consideration of the industrial problems of Scotland is essentially a long-term problem. I suppose one could put it in this way: that the aim should be to arrest the "brain-drain" and get steady growth in Scotland at least as great as that in any part of the Kingdom. That is what we should like to see. We are very much in a period of formation and transformation—transformation from the excessive reliance on the heavy industries to a much greater diversification of economic activity; the formation of the new generation needed to complete that transformation and to be ready for the next one, because we shall always be going from one transformation to another; a generation better qualified to adapt itself.
My Lords, of the quality of our manpower there can be no doubt. The fact that since the war over 50 companies from North America have set up in Scotland, accounting for over 70 per cent. of total manufacturing employment and 20 per cent. of our ex ports from Scotland, speaks for itself. We are grateful to our trans-Atlantic friends and we are grateful, also, to the Scottish Council for the work they have done in helping to attract American industry here and in "selling" Scotland in America. We are also grateful to the Board of Trade for the assistance they have given, which is perhaps sometimes rather overlooked in Scotland.
I think that in these United States and North American firms which come over there is one feature which is particularly desirable. This is that very often the American firms allow competition in exports with the parent industry in America. The result is that there is a constant comparison and emulation between the costs of the Scottish firm in this country and the costs of the parent company. This works right down the line. There is a feeling of emulation which is a tremendous spur to greater efficiency and to a feeling of teamwork. That is extremely desirable. Other countries have found that there is the same value in bringing work to Scotland. I believe that Germany is one of the countries involved.
Perhaps with English firms the argument does not apply to the same extent. One tends to find that when an English firm set up in Scotland they set up a specialised industry, or a part of their activities which is integrated into the whole of their activities in quite a different way: as often as not, it is not a duplication.
The result of this, whether it is a duplication or whether it is a part, is that there is, of course, always the danger of their withdrawing from Scotland in the event of recession; and when they rationalise they take the activity back into England, possibly to the main factory or elsewhere.
But perhaps what is worse than that, in many ways, is that there is a tendency for research, and, indeed, for the marketing and selling organisations, to be centralised at the headquarters in England. I think that one of the main objectives must be to get more industries based on Scotland—at least, more research carried out in Scotland—and I was very glad to see, just at the week-end, that a firm had decided to transfer its main headquarters to Scotland and to have the headquarters of its selling organisation in Scotland. That is the sort of thing I think we ought to encourage.
Now, how are we going to encourage, in particular, the bringing of research activities to Scotland? It is difficult to make suggestions which are of any great validity, but I should be grateful if the noble Lord would look into these suggestions that I am about to make. In the first place, I am sure that, as my noble friend Lord Selkirk, I think, said, we must try to get located in Scotland more Government research establishments of the type of the National Engineering Laboratory, which has done so well. I agree that scientists just do not know what they are missing in congregating in the South rather than coming to Scotland, where the possibilities of leisure and healthy activity are so very much greater. There is much more time available for people who live in Scotland; so much time is wasted in the South.
Secondly, could the Government look very carefully into the possibility of bringing some great international organisation to Scotland? This has been talked about, and I think it is something that would be of immense value to Scotland, because I think trade does follow the flag of UNO to a certain extent. I think it would be a great advantage to get one of the big international organisations in Scotland. Thirdly, can the Government give more research contracts to firms in Scotland? I think this goes particularly for the defence organisations. Time and time again one found at the Board of Trade that there were objections to removing defence activities to Scotland. In the Board of Trade my own experience was that one was constantly doing one's best to prevent firms from expanding where they were in England if they could possibly go elsewhere. But, personally, I had the feeling that it might well be that, while private industry was being prevented from expanding in England, where private industry had defence activities then it was made easier for it to expand in England rather than to move to other parts of the country.
Then, could the Government investigate further tax concessions on research establishments set up in development districts by private industry? I wonder whether the Government also could watch the effect of take-over bids and mergers between Scottish and English firms. So often they result in activities such as research activities being concentrated in the South. I do not say it is necessary that there should be a judgment whether the merger should or should not take place. What one wants to be certain of is that the Government have cognisance of mergers that are about to take place, and that they can influence the conditions in which they may take place. I should be very glad indeed if, where mergers of this kind were going to take place, it was made quite plain that distribution-of-industry considerations must be taken into account, and not least the provision of research in Scotland. Again—this is a small point, but it happens to be completely topical and current, and I wonder whether the noble Lord would answer it—if the Government set up something like the Council on Technology which was announced in the papers this morning, I believe, why is there not a Scottish industrialist on it? I see there are six industrialists there, but there seems to be no Scot.
My seventh point is that one must keep on improving air communications. I listened with great attention to my noble friend Lord Dundee, and there cannot be any doubt, quite apart from what the inhabitants of Dundee think about this—and, goodness knows, they think strongly enough about it; I am well aware of that from my own experience—but that the prospects of Dundee would be enormously improved by an airport: not just an airstrip for feeder services and execu- tive aircraft, but an airport. But, if we are going to have only feeder services and executive aircraft, then let them be organised so efficiently that they will be of real assistance to Dundee; so that there will be adequate capacity available for urgent trips and you will not have to book your trip weeks in advance in order to be able to get down to Edinburgh.
I am bound to comment, I think, on the curiosity (not to put it in any other way) of making virtually all air transport to the Continent pass through an overcrowded London. I do not know how many services there now are direct from Scotland to the Continent, but up to quite a short time ago I think there was only one to Paris, which went through Birmingham. I think one has to base this kind of calculation, again, on the longterm. Of course you will not manage to make it pay in the first year or so, but you have to provide adequate services from the start. If you do not have adequate services from the start, people will not use them; and if accommodation on them is not available, people will not use them.
LORD SNOW My Lords, may I interrupt the noble Lord for one moment? My memory was slipping a little when he talked about the Council of Technology. In fact, one member, Wilfred Brown, is a good Scot. He is the chairman of Glacier Metal, Limited.
LORD DRUMALBYN I am very much obliged to the noble Lord. I suspected this, but I wanted to find out. The truth is that Mr. Wilfred Brown is not in "Who's Who"—not vet.
My noble friend Lord Selkirk referred to the need for a closer link between industry and the universities. This is something which is growing very rapidly in Scotland. It is very interesting to see the way universities are carrying out researches, both for private enterprise and for the Government, and I think this is something which is very much along the right lines. At present it is undoubtedly true that people in Scotland are better off than ever before; but is this in part a reflection of conditions in Great Britain as a whole, or is it something which growth in Scotland is itself generating? For what we want to see is growth generated in Scotland itself. It is true that 80 per cent. of the industrial expansion in Scotland has taken place in firms already in Scotland, but that has not Been enough to compensate for the inevitable decline in employment in miring, in the railways, in manufactures for the railways and in agriculture, and for perhaps the less inevitable decline in shipbuilding.
My Lords, what a splendid thing it would be if the real break-through in the abandonment o restrictive practices and demarcation absurdities in shipbuilding were to come in the Clydeside!—that part of the country which, let us face it, is always a little suspect from the labour point of view. If only the Clydeside would make this breakthrough here and lead the way in it, what a tremendous advantage it would give to Scotland a; a whole! Other countries have succeeded in bringing all shipbuilding workers into one union, and I do not see why Scotland should not do that, too. It is estimated that productivity in shipbuilding would increase up to about 40 per cent. if it were done. I do not underestimate the difficulties, and I certainly do not want to try to make them any more difficult, but how marvellous it would be if they could be overcome in the Clydeside—and now, the moment when the shipbuilding credits effect is still being felt, seems to be just the moment to do it.
Do not let us underestimate the progress that has be en made—progress in the laying of the foundations of modernised industry for the future in Scotland. Despite the declining industries, as my noble friend Lord Dundee said, industrial production in the second quarter of 1964 stood at 27 per cent. above the 1958 level. Over the past four years the output per head has risen faster in Scotland than in the rest of the kingdom. I need not go into details, as I think they are well known. The engineering and electrical industries show a 13 per cent. increase over 1958, with a particularly high proportionate increase in the manufacturing of radio and other electronic apparatus. The output of the electronics industry has been increasing by about 15 per cent. a year, and is now worth over £20 million. There is more in prospect with the new factory at Newhouse for magnetic tape computers, and there is every prospect that this will continue to grow.
I should like an assurance from the Government (and I am sure that the noble Lord who is to reply will be dealing with this) that the planned level of expenditure in Central Scotland will not be reduced. We all recognise that the conception of the growth programme in Central Scotland is that we shall have an area of planned development from which prosperity will radiate outwards. There have been misgivings that the success which we confidently anticipate in this area will draw population away from other areas, and actually cause de-population and decline elsewhere, unless appropriate counter measures are taken to stimulate growth there, too. These misgivings are felt most strongly in areas where there is no large town capable of acting as a focus in itself. Dundee and Aberdeen can hold their own, at least so long as they are development districts, so long as they enjoy the benefits of the inducements in the Local Employment Act. But the Borders and the South-West have no such focus—I am not going to talk about the Highlands—and no such benefits either. In the Borders there is a shortage of manpower, because emigration is high; and emigration is high because there is insufficient diversification of industry and not sufficient choice of occupation.
Of course, much is needed, but may I mention what ought, I think, to be one cardinal step? That is the creation of a central focus: if not an industrial complex in itself, at least one which, together with the other Border burghs can form one. I believe that one of the Border burghs ought to be expanded, with Government assistance, and be enabled to attract modern engineering and electrical and chemical industries both to itself and to the other burghs.
The South-West is a special case for, apart from the coastal link with Stranraer to the North, it is virtually cut off from the rest of Scotland by the surrounding hills and sparsely populated areas; and it is cut off from West Cumberland by the Solway Firth. There is a main arterial link that passes through it and goes to Carlisle; and Carlisle, of course, exercises a great pull. Many people go from Dumfries to work in Carlisle, and also go there to shop and for entertainment. There is nothing much that can be done about the hill barrier, which is good sheep country and yields more and more in the way of timber. But there is something that can be done about the Solway to broaden the base of the economies of both South-West Scotland and West Cumberland. There is no communication between Dumfries and West Cumberland except through Carlisle. From Dumfries to Silloth direct, as the goose flies, one might say is 17 miles. The distance by road is 56 miles; and it takes a long time to get there through Carlisle.
Dumfries, I am sure, is the natural centre of the South-West—I do not think anybody would dispute that. I believe that Dumfries should be greatly expanded to become a focus for the South-West and, if necessary, with the surrounding burghs, an industrial complex. I believe also that if communications between the two sides of the Solway were improved it would be of great advantage both to South-West Scotland and to Cumberland—and indeed to Britain as a whole. Carlisle is becoming one of the worst bottlenecks in Britain. The main road arteries, as well as the main rail arteries, pass through Carlisle. I do not believe that communication between England and Scotland will ever be satisfactory until Carlisle is effectively by-passed. The line of the route could be to the West, across the Solway between Bowness and Annan, where the old railway viaduct, one and half miles long, ran. It was closed, I believe, in 1921, and demolished 30 years later.
Such a road would be of great value even if it brought no other benefits; but if it were carried along the top of a barrage containing fresh water fed by the rivers Eden, Esk and the Sark, a double benefit would accrue. The supply of water has been estimated by Dr. Drew, who put forward this joint scheme, as 2,000 million to 3,000 million a day for drinking; possibly for piping to Manchester and the like; possibly for cooling generating plant; and thereafter using the heated water for heating houses and factories, horticultural installations and even for raising soil temperatures. This is a wonderful project. What I should like from the noble Lord is an assurance that it is being seriously considered. There would be other benefits as well—for example, the recovery of land around the Solway.
I do not want to detain your Lordships much longer. I should like to make one point about the employment for women in the mining areas. The last figures I saw showed unemployment among women as 9.5 per cent. in Cumnock, 11.1 per cent. in Shorts and 24.5 per cent. in the Sanquhar development district. In the Sanquhar employment district there is hardly any industrial employment for women. Many must go 30 miles to Dumfries. It is disappointing that the new list of advance factories contains none for Sanquhar or Kirkconnel. One has already been built at Sanquhar and already let. It was always easier to let the second and third; and I hope that a second and third will soon be allocated. The one allocated to Cumnock, is about 17 miles from Sanquhar and is unlikely to help because it is needed for the Cumnock district itself. So I hope, as I say, that the Government will look at the question of employment for women in mining areas.
My Lords, I come to my last point. I said that this was a long-term problem. The best step of all in the long term is to give our children a sound grounding which will enable them to make a progressive contribution to Scotland's life in a changing world. It is good to see that almost our biggest growth industry is education. The numbers employed since 1958 have grown by proportionately more than in almost any other major activity except the motor vehicle manufacturing industry. I was glad to see that the Minister of Labour announced a new step yesterday to co-ordinate industrial education and training. But this was on a United Kingdom level. I am not at all certain that co-ordination should not take place in Scotland for Scotland; and elsewhere regionally, rather than nationally. I hope that the noble Lord will look into this point, with his colleague, the Under-Secretary of State responsible for Education.
I hope that he will also look at something that I looked at when I was at the Scottish Office, and that is the French system of apprenticeship centres, introduced after the war, where the first year is, I believe, roughly equivalent to our own year of pre-apprenticeship courses, and the next two years give particular technical education which enables somebody who gets a certificate to go into industry and six months later virtually to get a journeyman's ticket. I think that this would give the kind of broad basis of education which would be of tremendous value to our young people for the future.
I believe also that much greater vocational guidance is required at an early age than is given at the present time. I am sure that once a young person sees the way he is going, then he begins to get interested in what he is taught. As soon as it is possible to relate what a child is taught to the way in which he is going to earn his living, he becomes really vitally interested, because he knows it is of use to him. I firmly believe that in the education of our people, both in the education of our children and in many cases in the re-education of those who have to move from one job to another, lies one of the keys of the future prosperity of Scotland.
LORD GREENHILL My Lords, I wonder whether the noble Viscount, Lord Stonehaven, would give me one minute, as I have to leave the House and I should like to make my peace with the noble Lord, Lord Craigton. If I have given him the impression that I was rather hostile to his general approach when he was opening the debate, I want to make it perfectly clear that I was following him but wondering whether he was adopting the, balanced method of debate we prefer to have in your Lordships' House. Therefore, if he feels that I have been somewhat unkind, perhaps he will excuse me. I withdraw any kind of reflection on him that he thought I was making.
LORD CRAIGTON I did, my Lords, and I am extremely grateful to the noble Lord.
LORD BRECON My Lords, may I ask just one question? The noble Lord, Lord Snow, assured my noble friend Lord Drumalbyn that there is a Scotsman on the Council for Technology. I would ask him why there is not a Welshman, and whether he will add one more to it and allow the Principality to help on that Council.

VISCOUNT STONEHAVEN My Lords, I want to join other noble Lords in congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Hughes, on his appointment on the other side of the House. Like many other noble Lords, I have pleasant memories of associations with the noble Lord, but perhaps somewhat more humdrum. We appeared together on Grampian television, where we sat on chairs and had our faces powdered—and the noble Lord had his head powdered, too.
My interest is really in the North-East, but I am not going to talk about that now because I have been rightly warned off talking about that. However, I want to give advance notice of one or two questions that I should like to ask later on. I do not want answers now but I should like to put in my spoke. In general, the question of the North-East area must revolve to a large extent around its indigenous industries, which are largely concerned with agriculture, forestry, fisheries and tourism. I am not going to talk about any of these now, but I would ask the noble Lord if he will inquire into the possibilities of creating a new industry for using small sizes of timber, other than the pulping industry which is out of our reach. In particular, I should like to know what has been happening about the possibilities of producing laminated scantlings of standard sizes for use in building.
Also, is anything being done about the modern technique of finger-jointing of the short sections of timber which we often get when cutting young wood? They are quite large pieces of wood but short. The difficulty of using these has been overcome overseas by finger-jointing, by means of which they build up full-strength timber in sections of any length. Industries of this type would be applicable to the North-East. I put these questions forward now so that when we come to a debate which is to be held in a few weeks' time, when I shall be speaking about these matters again, the noble Lord will have had warning that I am bringing up these points.
I should like to have my say on transport. In regard to road transport, it is a pity that local government priorities are not scrutinised more closely. I think that the butter should be spread thicker where it is wanted and not so thinly over the whole job. Local politicians would not agree with that, but I think that in the national interest this is true. As to railways, Governments come and Governments go, but among those on either side of the House I stand in solitary splendour and support British Railways. I think that the long-distance railway service is magnificent. If you want a better service than you get between London and Aberdeen you can go round the world three times and will not find it. That is my stand on the railways.
As regards air travel, I am tempted to tell the story of the Aberdeen professor who went to Glasgow to speak at an important lunch. He took off from Aberdeen and landed in Inverness, where he remained for a couple of days. We must remember that our Scottish weather conditions are not ideal for air travel. There is no greater service which the noble Lord could do, if he is a superman—which I think he is—than to din into the heads of B.E.A. and all the other airlines that people do not like sitting on their behinds for forty-five minutes waiting to get from one aeroplane to another. No doubt this was necessary when they had to weigh carefully every passenger and his luggage for the kind of aeroplanes used years ago., Now, if you turned up with a steamroller it would not make any difference. This kind of situation is intolerable and does a lot of harm. I wish that the noble Lord would do whatever he possibly can about this little problem.
If the noble Lord has already delved into his files, he will have found a file about the Glenfeshie road scheme, or controversy. I would point this out to him. If he goes to Norway, when he gets time, he will find that in spite of the climate there is hardly a paved road in the country. All the roads are gravel. They carry very heavy traffic and keep open, except in the most severe snow, and are perfectly adequate for the heavy traffic they carry. That is one point. The other is that if he will look into the accounts of the Forestry Commission, he will find that the Commission can make a road, according to their estimates, for £3,490 per mile up to their full standard. There is a 14-mile gap at Glenfeshie. I would suggest that, if the noble Lord looked at it from the point of view of making a dual carriageway—that is to say, two Forestry Commission roads—he could get them made at a cost much below £100,000 and have two first-class roads for reconstruction at a later date into a final road system. In the meantime, they would open up quite a large part of country for forestry work to Fort William and have very great tourist and winter sports advantages.
It is only because people start talking about so many millions of pounds being involved that road schemes are put off. I think that we should look at what the Forestry Commission do and let them take this on to see whether they cannot do it, and do it for less. I very much hope the noble Lord will look at this question on these lines to see whether something of this sort could be done. Nothing is done by people who want perfection before they do anything at all.
That is all I want to say. I may have to catch a train before the noble Lord replies, so I hope that he will forgive me if I do not wait. I have said nothing to which I want an answer, in any event.

THE MARQUESS OF LOTHIAN My Lords, I should like to join in the general thanks expressed by noble Lords to my noble friend Lord Craigton for enabling the House to discuss Scotland to-day. I should also like to add my congratulations to the noble Lord, Lord Hughes, on his appointment, and to wish him well in his new post. We all know that he has the welfare of Scotland at heart, and I am quite certain that he has the talents to carry out his task. While I do not wish to go into this in detail, I would associate myself with what my noble friend Lord Craigton and others have said regarding the division of posts in the Scottish Office. I think it is a pity that the noble Lord, Lord Hughes, is not Minister of State. I believe he will find things difficult, and I hope that perhaps the Government may reconsider the position, in the light of what has been said in this House to-day. It is to me possibly just another example of the fact that we have exchanged a Scottish Prime Minister for an English one.
My purpose in intervening briefly in this debate is to refer to that part of Scotland where I live, and which I know best—namely, the Border, to which my noble friend Lord Drumalbyn has already made reference. As many noble Lords know, all is not well in that beautiful region, because we are living under the shadow of a fundamental and, so far, permanent problem—that of creeping depopulation. Year by year the figures of population are gradually going down. It is a slow and not easily perceptible process. But if it is allowed to continue, I am afraid that the area will become one of an economic and social tragedy; and it will also place art increasingly difficult burden on the remaining ratepayers.
The reasons for the depopulation are, I think, quite simple. They are two. First, the increasing mechanisation of agriculture has mea it that less labour is needed on the land. This is inevitable, and is an excellent thing, provided that it produces a more efficient agricultural community. The other reason is the general lack of new light industries to supplement the four main Border trades of tweed, hosiery, farming and forestry. A further problem lies in the fact that, as your Lordships know, the tweed and hosiery industries employ a preponderance of female labour, and even now some of this is begin fling to be imported from as far as 40 to 50 miles away. The result of all this is an unbalanced and unhealthy social climate, with the woman working in the factory, and, as my noble friend Lord Drumalbyn hinted, many of the menfolk finding employment outside the region, and even living outside the region. I think your Lordships will agree that this is not a desirable state of affairs.
That is a brief outline of the picture. It is a picture which the casual visitor, who sees the prosperous farms and lively, industrious little towns, does not always appreciate. But I can assure your Lordships that the Border people are well aware of it. The last Government were well aware of this, arid I trust that the present Government are equally aware of it.
Of course the solution to this problem is not an easy one, b at I should like to make a few brief suggestions. The Border has never been classified as a development district, because. I think there is little or no unemployment there. Even if this is based on the excellent principle of "first things first", it seems to me to be a slightly short-sighted view, for depopulation can have List as serious consequences as unemployment, if less obvious ones. I feel quite certain—and I think local opinion in the Borders would agree with me—that unless and until industrialists and manufacturers are given positive financial inducement to come to the Borders as they are given to go to other parts of the country, they will not do so. A good supply of labour and beautiful scenic amenities are not enough: grants, cheap borrowing facilities, depreciation allowances, and so on, are required. In fact, as usual, it is money that "talks" in these matters; and I do not think it would have to talk for long for small industries—and I am thinking particularly of those which might draw their raw materials from the area, such as timber and the output of the forests—to be persuaded to come to the Borders.
In my nearest town, Jedburgh, which has a population of about 4,000, two factories have closed in the last two or three years, one a tweed factory and the other making blankets. To balance that, one American-owned factory, making precision tools and now employing about 250 people, has opened. It is interesting to note that this firm have opened up their business in a factory built and financed by the county council, and they are repaying the county council in instalments. But the point is that one or two factories of this sort are simply not enough. It means that there is a lack of competition for labour; wage rates suffer accordingly, and there is insufficient demand and stimulus for the local councils to provide more housing and the civic amenities which a developing community should have.
I think that we have in the Borders at present too many industrial eggs in too few baskets. That is why I suggest that Her Majesty's Government should consider setting up one or two industrial estates, sited near some of the smaller Border towns. I believe that this would be preferable to a completely New Town, as it would spread the benefit of industrialisation widely throughout the region; and although it would present a difficult housing problem for smaller burghs and towns, it would have the added advantage of giving live status and viability to these small towns. It would also have the advantage, one would hope, of increasing the supply of local female labour. And if the population grew well enough, it would enable some of these towns to have rather fuller educational facilities than they have at present, in a situation where children over the age of, say, fourteen, frequently have to travel long distances to school to complete their education. But this is a point about which my noble friend Lady Elliot of Harwood is far more qualified to speak than I am.
If the Borders are to be revitalised (and I hope that I may be forgiven for returning for a moment to my former subject) it will be necessary to come to a quick decision regarding the provision of a new general hospital for the area. The existing hospital, which is a war-time temporary hospital, is doing a fine job, and it has recently been upgraded. At the same time, it is not adequate, I think, for the demands and standards of modern medicine; and with any increase in population and industrial development it will clearly become quite inadequate. Whether there is to be a new hospital on the same site or a new hospital on another site is, of course, a matter for the hospital board; but it is important that some decision should be taken soon. The present uncertainty is bad for the doctors, for the staff and for patients, and no real long-term planning can be undertaken. I would ask the noble Lord to bear this in mind, because I think it is one of the most urgent requirements of the area.
Another requirement would be—and this has been touched on by several of your Lordships—the improvement of road links. I think much more urgent consideration should be given to a reappraisal of this problem. We know that it is being done in the long-term planning, but in my area these links will certainly need to be improved. Although tourism is quite outside the scope of this debate, it will, I feel sure, become one of the main industries of the Border region. For that reason alone, there is a great argument in favour of increasing and improving the road links that we have. I am not going to discuss forestry, although it is an increasing Border industry. I understand, and hope, that we shall have an opportunity of debating that subject before very long.
My noble friend Lord Craigton has referred to the question of local government reform, and I should like to endorse what he said about this, for it is, I think, a matter of particular interest to the Border country where there are several small, and comparatively poor, local authorities. There may be advantage in amalgamations, but I know that the proposals contained in the White Paper have for some time been under active consideration. My noble friend Lord Craigton has told us that. What we do not know is how the new Government are approaching this rather delicate problem, and I should be grateful if the noble Lord could throw any light upon it. Equally, as I think has already been said, your Lordships might like to have some information about the Board of Trade Survey which was started a year or so ago: what progress is being made, and when we can expect a Report. The last Government were hoping to produce their Report by, I think, the summer of 1965. Is that still going to be the case?—because when this Survey was set up it was felt that it was going to contribute greatly to a solution of the serious problems of the Borders, some of which I have touched upon to-day. So I hope the noble Lord will chase this up and see that we get it on time.
In view of the lateness of the hour, and the many speakers in the debate today, I have tried to confine my remarks briefly to some rather local and parochial problems. I would, in conclusion, ask the noble Lord, Lord Hughes, very earnestly not to forget them in the welter of other and, perhaps, more dramatic-sounding issues with which he will be faced, for I think that if ever there was a case for "a stitch in time", the Border regions of Scotland is that case.

THE EARL OF CROMARTIE My Lords, I should like to start by adding my tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Hughes, in his new post. I shall not forget his kindness to me after my maiden speech in your Lordships' House, when I broke several Rules of procedure He was very kind about it.
As usual, and quite naturally, the majority of your Lordships have spoken of the industrial belt and the Borders. As usual, I will come back to the Highlands. There is to-day a more acute awareness of the problems of the Highlands than there has been for over half a century. There has been a determination on the part of informed Highlanders to make their views and aspirations felt. The reason for this was the indirect result of the proposals made to abandon the railways flora and west of Inverness, and of the introduction of new ferry services to tie Islands which are designed to meet the convenience of the tourist and not the needs of the inhabitants. Transport is paramount in any consideration of Highland problems, and unless the needs of the inhabitants are given priority over other considerations when transport is being planned, there is little hope that other suggestions for a revival of economic activity could be implemented.
A report on the present state of the Highland economy, and on how best improvements can be made, has recently been published under the title of Highland Opportunity. I have no doubt some of your Lordships have seen it. This report has listed important sources of weakness in the economy, such as the inadequate use of land, the wide dispersion of labour, the small proportion employed in manufacturing industry, the small size of commercial units, and the under-utilisation of crofting capacity. It has suggested, among other things, certain principles for the expansion of the Highlands: that they should exploit their own resources; that they should export out of the Highlands, and that they should develop products of high value, et cetera. What is of interest is that recently a London Ism of business consultants, without prejudice or knowledge of the Highlands, should consider the potential profitability of this lonely but magnificent countryside to be very considerable.
May I emphasise this belief that expansion of economic and industrial activity would be profitable? May I also suggest that, with sensible Government policy, the Highlands can be immensely profitable, not only to those directly developing the undeveloped potential, but also to Britain as a whole? It seems essential that a centre to co-ordinate further research and development should be established in the area, and that its activities should be controlled from within the Highlands. A great chance was missed when the new Scottis university was not given to Inverness. However, with the proper policy for the use of land, with capital grants for the reclamation of potentially fertile land and, most important, maintenance grants for the succeeding ten years, payable, like the aban- doned marginal agricultural production grants, only on condition that lime and fertilisers are liberally applied; and with low interest loans available for the stocking of the reclaimed glens and slopes, this country could produce the store stock which are, and will be, so badly needed for fattening in the South to replace the imported meat which will become more and more scarce as the world population rises and the standard of living in the primitive countries of the world rises.
The development of forestry can go on side by side with this regeneration, and can assist it by giving shelter and access roads. At present, forestry employs four times as many people to the square mile as hill sheep farming and the sporting use of land. I would suggest that on reclaimed and properly enclosed and stocked land, farming could employ double the men that forestry employs. For this development to take place, it is essential that there is a proper policy for the use of land, and that the Highland Development Board, when it is set up, has powers to study land usage. I believe that in very similar Scandinavian countries many of these problems have already been overcome.
The Board will also require powers to deal with any selfish use of Highland land resources. I am not suggesting for one minute that there is no room for sport in the Highlands. It brings to our country a great deal of money, and provides employment and a way of life to a very fine body of men. I refer, of course, to stalkers, keepers and ghillies. But sport must not be allowed to act as a barrier to the re-population of the Highlands, or prevent the growth of amenities. It should, on the contrary, be another source of employment and benefit to the Highlands.
At the same time as consideration is given to the basic primary industries of agriculture, forestry and fishing, it appears desirable that incentives should be designed to encourage industry to develop, not in the overcrowded South, but in the empty North, where there is an abundance of land, clean air, good water and electricity; and where there is labour of a high degree of integrity and intelligence available. Most of the Highland areas are scheduled development districts, and receive the usual incentives in grants, loans and special depreciation treatment. It would appear that it would be in the country's interest—I mean the interest of the whole of Britain—to offer an extra incentive to deal with the one great disadvantage suffered by the Highlands to which I drew attention earlier on, namely, transport.
A decision to apply a tapered freight rate and a reduced fuel tax within the area would, I think, have a dramatic effect on this region where, between 1951 and 1961, 5 per cent. of the mainland population and 10 per cent. of the island population left, and where many of the young people of enterprise and talent are being forced to leave and find opportunities of employment commensurate with their abilities. What better place to site some of the new industries of the s and s than out of the existing overcrowded centres of industry in the South? This "Northern Six" of Great Britain I believe to be an area of unlimited possibility whose development becomes more and more essential to the development of Great Britain as a whole.
Turning to another industry whose potential is important, but not all-important, and I refer, of course, to the tourist trade, I was going to read out an extract from the Highland Opportunity report on this question, but it is rather long and time is short so I will not; I will spare noble Lords that. But I suggest especially that those noble Lords on this side of the House who have been closely concerned with the tourist trade should read this, because it qualifies quite a number of the conditions and is rather critical of the appeal to the mass tourist trade which is probably (and I agree) not a good thing. Briefly, their suggestion is that the tourist trade in the Highlands should to a great extent be selective. I will not go further into that question, because it is all laid out, extremely clearly; but I think it is very important.
I know that these particular few paragraphs in the report will not be popular among a certain type of hotel-keeper and a certain type of development tycoon from the cities. But just to give your Lordships a little example of my own experience in the West Highlands, I will tell the following story. A hotelier friend of mine, who is a cultured and educated man, had as one of his guests an obviously prosperous man from the South who, during the course of his conversation, said how much he would like to see the Highland glens filled with Wimpey Bars. The gentleman could not quite understand the rather unenthusiastic reception he got from the hotelier. That, quite briefly, is what I am trying to say. We all know that there is a tremendous future for the tourist industry, but it must not take the place of the far more important and far more worthwhile aspects of development which we all want in the Highlands.
Finally, my Lords, I should like to mention briefly the suggested changes in local government—not that we in local government know very much about them yet. Some changes may be necessary, especially if they entail the transference of certain rate burdens from local to the central Government. But let us beware of creating a condition when the local authority councillor ceases to represent the people and becomes just another faceless civil servant. This would, I think, become inevitable if, in the huge areas of the Highlands, the county councils were to be replaced by regional councils.

LORD BALERNO My Lords, I should like at the outset to draw your Lordships' attention to two scientific developments for which Scotland is uniquely placed to provide the home. The first is the National Resources Council recommended by the Trend Report. The Slater Committee, which reported on this, blandly assumed that the Council should operate from London. To forward their policy of restricting the construction of offices in London, I trust that the Government will take note that the location of a new body presents them with a wonderful opportunity of implementing that policy by placing its organisations throughout various parts of Britain, thereby also spreading economic growth.
The Natural Resources Symposium organised by the Scottish Council in 1960 clearly demonstrated the fundamental—and, I would add, peculiar—importance of this subject in Scotland. Natural resources development will involve many existing Government Departments and establishments. The chosen location must have a strong departmental framework, and such a framework, I submit, exists in Edinburgh; and forbye (as we say in Scotland) the University of Edinburgh has recently created a Chair of Natural Resources, and the Professor has got down to his job. The noble Baroness, Lady Horsbrugh, has reminded the noble Lord, Lord Hughes, of his own views on the movement of Government offices. And here, with the placement of new offices, he has a wonderful opportunity of immediately implementing his own convictions.
The noble Lord. Lord Hughes, whom I should like to congratulate on his new post, has done some exceptionally good work for the hospitals and medical services in Scotland, and the second development to which I wish to draw the attention of the Government, and to press upon them, is the decision of the World Health Organisation to establish a World Centre for Medical Research. I would press it not only on the grounds that Edinburgh is a capital city—in every sense of the word—or that the Medical School of the University is renowned for its research, but at least equally because of the great capacity that the Scot has shown in his ability to play a part in the affairs of the world. And in this connection may I say that it has been particularly gratifying to see the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Orr, in the Chamber of the House yesterday and to-day. No Scot has done more than he has in international affairs for good and health. I understand that the World Health Organisation are likely to reach a decision next year. I hope that we may receive from the Government an assurance that they are alive to the possibilities and that our case will be vigorously presented at Geneva.
I wish to draw your Lordships' attention to the drain away from Scotland of her young scientists and technologists; and I do so not only in order to emphasise the grave personal problem that confronts these young men of talent or to re-emphasise the perennial complaint about the migration of the Scot. Please God we shall always produce in Scotland young men, scientists included, who have the urge to adventure furth of Scotland. This is a natural phenomenon of the Scottish race. Not all Scots are driven out through poverty at home or the lack of opportunity. Many Scots are born with 898"itchy feet", and these we are usually glad to export.
I should also like to place on the Record that there is a steady, though small, flow of young scientists in the reverse direction from the Adjacent Kingdom and Principality into Scotland. In Scotland we welcome them for their charm and their more sophisticated way of life, but more for the resulting cross-fertilisation of ideas and techniques. That they are welcome can be gauged from the large proportion who settle in Scotland and for the rest of their lives eschew the fleshpots of the South-East of England.
My Lords, that is my purpose to-day, to make this point: that after allowing for the adventurous Scot and for the immigrant English, there is a substantial net flow out of Scotland of scientists and technologists; and this net flow is the manifestation of a much deeper trouble in the industrial bowels of our nation. Before I elaborate on this, I should like to give some figures to illustrate the extent of this problem.
In the Toothill Report on Scottish industry figures are given of the degrees and diplomas awarded in pure science and technology. Expressed as a percentage of Great Britain, Scotland produces 11 per cent. of the graduates in pure science and over 18 per cent. of the diplomates in technology, making a combined total of 12½ per cent. Against this we must put the percentage of posts for scientists and technologists in Scotland as compared to the United Kingdom. An inquiry made by A. G. Clement and Robert Robertson, through an examination of posts advertised, revealed that in 1960 only some 3 per cent. of the British total of scientific posts in industry were to be found in Scotland—and we are producing 12½ per cent. of the scientists and technologists.
Had it not been for the enlightened attitude of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and also of the Atomic Energy Authority, this figure would have been very much lower. Indeed, it is largely because of them that this figure has probably risen in the last three or four years, and stands now possibly at 4 per cent., or maybe even at 5 per cent. But taking it that the proportion of persons employed in industry in Scotland as a proportion of the United Kingdom is 9 per cent., to employ in Scotland only 4 per cent. of the scientists and technologists produced is a very poor show. My thesis is to uncover the reason for this astounding discrepancy, a discrepancy which, if it is allowed to continue, is bound to lead to more rumblings of discontent from North of the Border.
The conception of a proper infrastructure of industry, which is so much spoken about, is accepted as the prime requisite for expansion anywhere. I do not quarrel with this conception, but in this age the most important item, I submit, in this infra-structure—that is, science and technology—is often forgotten. To have industries and factories that are virtually little more than assembly plants adds little to the permanent wealth of the nation. In the event of world recession these outlying factories will be the first to close. I should like to quote a submission by the Scottish Council to the Secretary of State, made, I think, last July. They wrote: In many industries the dynamic source of growth is technology—the continuous and rapid use of scientific knowledge. This is just as true of the development and survival of established products as it is of the evolution of new products. Recognition of this proposition which the Scottish Council have made is absolutely fundamental to any discussion on the development of industry in Scotland.
The greater part of all research and design in Britain is paid for by the Government and the nationalised industries, which also dominate the market for many products of industry. The location of Ministries and head offices in London has resulted in the extremely uneven spread of that knowledge which is the dynamic source of much industrial growth and, consequently, of new business. This is the principal reason for the magnetic pull of London for many industries. New knowledge is thought to be more easily accessible to companies near London. Government administrators, scientific staff and Treasury officials collaborate in letting contracts, and this means that Government laboratories in the spending departments have to be in the South. But, my Lords, is this true? Must they be in the South? The South-East of England enjoys no special natural advantages. Why do we blandly assume a continuing immigration into the South-East at a rate of 50,000 persons a year when the main reason for so doing is the inefficiency in communications between Government Departments and the centres where scientific research is carried out?
I agree that the spread of new ideas and information about opportunities are essentially a function of personal meetings, but does it necessarily follow from this that the centres for industrial research must be grouped into the South-East of England? Consider biological research in Britain—medical and agricultural. The centres for these are well scattered throughout the land and have been able to overcome this communications difficulty. Given a proper appreciation of the problem, surely this can also be done with industrial research.
I would repeat that it is the Government Departments and the nationalised industries that pay for the larger part of all the research and development work undertaken in Britain, and that a great deal of this is done within the laboratories and the factories of industry. If industry is to grow, as grow it must, then the source of growth must be more evenly distributed. The mere transplantation of companies alone will not do the job. This can be achieved by getting design and development work going on a larger scale within the laboratories and design offices of industry itself in Scotland and other places. If this happens, then growth will follow and will continue. If it does not happen, there will be no end to the need to import industry from the South, and the problem of an impoverished Scotland and North of England with the continuing spectre of unemployment will be ever with us.
Where the development of technology has been fostered in Scotland there have been remarkable results. Deliberately this has been done by the Government in the establishment at East Kilbride of the National Engineering Laboratory, and somewhat fortuitously around Edinburgh with the growth of the electronics industry. We in Scotland should not forget that the decision of the D.S.I.R. to open up at East Kilbride was taken when Sir Edward Appleton was its mainspring. This establishment, the National Engineering Laboratory, may prove as important to Scotland in the th century as the founding 150 years ago in Glasgow by John Anderson of the first college of technology in the whole world. With these two examples, the ultimate success of the policy of locating more industrial research away from London and in Scotland and the North of England. cannot be called in question. Only by this means can we get dynamic industrial growth, and continuing growth.
I would strongly support the plea of the noble Lord, Lord Drumalbyn, that additional tax incentives should be given to companies undertaking research and development in those areas where growth is needed. l hesitate to mention another form of financial incentive—rather is it, indeed, a disincentive to stick around London. So long as larger salaries are paid to civil servants and scientists in the London area, so long will there be a drift to the South, for quite a lot of social prestige can be gained from claiming to be in a better-paid job. I know that the extra salaries are in respect of the alleged extra hazards and expenses of living in London, but. I think it is time this matter was looked into dispassionately. I would submit that if salaries in and around London were the same as in Wales, Northumberland and Scotland, there would be much less reluctance to move out of the South-East of England.
LORD BRECON In the manufacturing industries the average wage in Wales is higher than it is in London.
LORD BALERNO The point I was making was about civil servants being compressed in the South-East of England and in the London area: and it is the higher wages paid Ito the civil servants that I am dealing with particularly at the moment.
There must also be a much wider acceptance of the potential of air travel, of which we have heard so much, and which, in point of time, brings Central Scotland as near to Central London as is the Southampton—Portsmouth area. I support the noble Viscount, Lord Stone-haven, about the frustrations of air travel in this Island, and this situation must be corrected—that long stand we have in the Palace of Cromwell Road as the passenger waits to get "processed"; or, on his return home, that frustrating 20 minutes or half an hour at London Airport before he can be reintegrated with his bag.
Last century was the golden age of Scottish industry. It was golden because, starting with Joseph Black and his discovery of the analysis of carbon dioxide, which led to the inventions of James Watt, it was science-based. Sufficient of the native genius for invention remained in Scotland to give us the steam engine, the reciprocating engine, the screw propeller and a host of other inventions. The engineers who were exported in those days were largely in the steamships that sailed the world. They returned to Scotland, and their sons went to the universities and technical colleges, only to find no outlet in Scotland for their inventiveness and industry.
To-day, opportunities for civil engineers in Scotland are few and far between. There are few physicists employed in industry in Scotland, the country of Napier and Clerk Maxwell. If the geophysicist wants a job he has to go to Dallas, Texas. The chemists cannot find a job in Scotland at all. Despite the fact that we have quite a few chemical industries in Scotland, most of the research is done elsewhere—though I am glad to note that the North British Rubber Company, in its development at Newbridge, is planning a new research centre. We are the country of Mackintosh who, with his rubber mixed with naptha, produced the mackintosh. We have lost that chemical inventiveness in Scotland, and our people have to go outside. But to-day it is coming back again; and, thanks chiefly to the developing electronics industry around Edinburgh, electrical and mechanical engineers in Scotland have a better prospect. I could expatiate further on this point, because I feel strongly about this impossibility of scientists, young scientific graduates and technologists, getting a job in Scotland. The boys at school know about this—their masters tell them about it. They hear about boys four or five years older than themselves graduating and being unable to get jobs.
I should like to conclude by drawing your Lordships' attention to a point of fact which you can easily verify by stepping across the road into Westminster Abbey. A scrutiny of the tombs and memorials of the scientists there will reveal that one-fifth of them were Scots. After making allowance for those Scottish scientists who returned to their native land to die, this, to a Scotsman, is a most sobering thought.

BARONESS ELLIOT OF HARWOOD My Lords, I shall not detain your Lordships for many minutes but, like all Scottish people, I should like in a debate of this kind to have a word. I think this debate has shown that one of our true characteristics is that we like talking. We like talking about ourselves, and we do not much mind if nobody else is listening. I have been watching the Benches opposite, and I must say that while I am most happy to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Hughes, on his appointment, I really have to condole with him to-day because, when the noble Earl who follows me has spoken, we shall have had 13 speeches from this side of the House as against one from opposite. The noble Lord, Lord Greenhill, splendid as he is, was their only speaker, and there is Lord Hughes to wind up. However, I have a strong feeling that, as a staunch Presbyterian, he probably has, somewhere within his make-up, a sling which he will be able to use as effectively as did David against Goliath. We on this side have provided him with some thirteen targets. I only hope that he will not knock us all down because, in point of fact, I think that most of us are anxious that he should make a success of his job. As somebody has said to-day, we are all anxious to see benefits coming to Scotland, a continuing process of that which we on this side believe to have been carried out in the last ten or twelve years.
I should like to congratulate, too, my noble friend Lord Craigton on the splendid way in which he conducted his office during the last Government. One has only to travel to Scotland, as I do, and as I did particularly during the Election, to see the tremendous developments that have taken place in the great industrial belt. The noble Lord who has just sat down spoke about East Kilbride and the research centre there. In East Kilbride one can see a place which, ten or so years ago, was a tiny village, where there is a splendid new town, marvellously set out, wonderful roads, wonderful communications, first-class factories, and where 39,000 people are living to-day. This is an achievement. The noble Lord, Lord Hughes, himself has been chairman of another great new town in Fife.
So we have not to take a depressing view about Scotland, because we are a highly developing and enthusiastic people who are only anxious to do more than is being done at the present time. We hope that Lord Hughes will carry on this work, and that we shall not have to come back here and find out that things have gone backwards when we are anxious that they should go forward.
I should like to say a word about the area in which I and the noble Marquess, Lord Lothian, live, which has been, I am afraid, one of the less developed areas in recent years. I do not grudge the central belt of Scotland its prosperity. I do not grudge the developments that have taken place there; it is all right and proper. But let us look a little at other areas and see what can be done to help them. The Borders is a curious place, because one can say that it is right in the middle of Scotland, that it must be an easy place to reach, and so on. But in point of fact, although the Highlands look so far away and so underpopulated, as it were, the Borders are far south and we have a kind of invisible barrier which is the frontier with England. I am not saying this in any antagonistic spirit at all, because we go backwards and forwards over the frontier and nobody really knows which is one side and which the other, except those who live on the North side. But it is a fact that we in the Border area are quite isolated from the industrial developments, with the result that we find it difficult to attract industry and to keep our people in that area.
The three reasons why I think we ought to do something for the Borders are: to stop depopulation; to provide a balanced employment position there; and to provide the additional labour, particularly by women, which we need for our hosiery industry. Another curious factor is that we have not really got an unemployment problem, either. Our unemployment figure is between 1 and 2 per cent. In October of this year it was less than 1 per cent. One cannot plead that there is r o employment there; there is employment, but people are leaving to go to the industrial belt, and also they travel out of the area. We want to try to develop certain industries in order to keep our people, to prevent depopulation, and to bring prosperity to the Borders.
There is one industry which is capable of expanding and is, in the technical term of to-day, called a growth point—that is, the hosiery industry. The value of that industry in 1959 was £22,815,000; to-day the value is £27,944,000. That is an increase of 22 per cent. I believe that the town of Howick, very near to where I live, has the biggest exports per head of population of any town in the United Kingdom. This may be a tall story, but it is one I have teen told on several occasions, and I believe it to be true. When exports are the one development which we are really working for, here is an industry which could expand if labour were available.
The labour needed is women, on the whole, and therefore it is difficult to get more women unless one also has another industry which will employ the men. In this modern world where men and women both work it is employment for men which we need to find. This is one of the reasons why I hope that the noble Lord, when he is studying this matter, will look to the Borders and see whether we cannot make in the Borders, as the noble Marquess has suggested, an industrial estate; or, if not, take an area near one of the big towns and develop it so that we can enlarge the hosiery industry.
I must not talk for long because of the time, but I should like to say one other word. I join forces with the noble Viscount, Lord Stonehaven, on the subject of railways. A great deal has been said about air travel, and I am not in the least opposed to it, but I am a staunch supporter of the railways. I travel twice a week on the railways from my home at Howick and back again. I prefer the railways to any other form of transport. The railways in the Borders are very important indeed; they are, in my opinion, every bit as important as they are in the Highlands. Unless one has a railway which goes through the Border from east to west, from Edinburgh to Carlisle, and which passes through all those small hosiery towns which are capable of great development, one is going to cut off that area completely. Any money which is spent on the roads will improve transport conditions, but we happen to live in a cold climate, and in the very severe winter only two years ago the roads were blocked and one could not travel anywhere. The railways remain open nearly all the time, and it would be a disaster if they were closed.
Dr. Beeching has his finger on that railway in his Plan which we all know so well. He has scheduled what is called the Waverley line to be done away with. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Hughes, will consider this matter very carefully indeed. If the railway is taken away from the Borders that area will be completely isolated. Perhaps some day there will be found a place for an airport, though it would be very difficult in such hilly country; so it looks as though the transport in that area must remain railway transport. I hope that we shall be able to preserve our railway. It may need to be altered; perhaps there may not need to be so many stations—I do not know; but let us have this line which links us with Edinburgh and Carlisle and enables us to travel through the Borders. Otherwise it is a matter of travelling 40, 50 or 60 miles before one gets to a railway station. I beg the noble Lord seriously to consider this, and he will then earn the gratitude of the Border people.
That is all I wanted to say. I think it is important that we should not leave out this area. It is said that there is so much depopulation that the work is not developing there as it should do. We could speak of the agricultural and forestry activities which are carried on there, but, as the noble Marquess has said, the number of people in those industries goes down with the efficiency and additional mechanisation which takes place. Therefore, if we are going to keep our young people and to offer them a future in that area, it is necessary that we should at some point of development find a growth point, which I think is there if it can only be taken up. I ask the noble Lord, in this long marathon to which he has listened all the way through, not to forget this area.

THE EARL OF PERTH My Lords, we are all most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Craigton, for initiating this debate at this rather early moment of time in the new Government. Our purpose in Scottish debates, as your Lordships well know, is not to be contentious or to score Party points, but rather to put forward suggestions of the various ways in which we think the Government may be able to help things to go forward in Scotland. Therefore, to have an early debate while things are fluid must be good. I hope the noble Lord, Lord Hughes, will find that what we have all tried to do and say will perhaps be of use to him in his battle with other of the Government Departments with which he has to contend. It is already after seven o'clock, yet we have confined our debate to-day to Scottish industry. That is just as well. But we have been able to do that with a fairly clear conscience because we know that before long we shall have another debate which will cover matters like the Highlands agriculture, forestry and tourism. We shall have an opportunity to discuss those subjects when we ask for the second part of the debate.
I certainly want to join everybody else in congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Hughes, on his position. I do not want to go into the question whether or not he should be promoted, except to say that I think the anxiety on that point, quite apart from his own merits, is based on the fact that, by his not being promoted, we may find Scottish affairs becoming more and more centralised in Whitehall. This is a process which the last Government were able considerably to reverse.
Again, I wish to join with many other noble Lords in congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Craigton, and indeed the previous Secretary of State for Scotland and others, in being able to reverse the process and in making us feel that things were happening in Scotland for Scotland. That is why we have this anxiety on the question of the status of Lord Hughes. I also wish to congratulate Lord Craigton, and others who were with him in the Scottish Office, on the great progress which we saw in Scotland during their tenure of office. They faced a difficult task. The wheels of heavy industry were running down.
The problem was what could be done to stop the process, to get it reversed and to get the light engineering and other industries going. The record shows how well they succeeded in achieving this. I only wish that the new Government will continue the good work and, indeed, ensure that what has been started will go ever faster and faster.
It is very important that the new Government, in making their new surveys and new planning, should not upset the existing mechanisms, which are delicate mechanisms and could easily be upset. The fact that one may set up additional boards is not in itself an answer which means that you will have new industry, or more industry, or an increase in industrial output. Bureaucracy itself is not industry, nor does it produce industry. I have particularly in mind that nothing should be done to upset the work of the Scottish Council. Your Lordships all know what a splendid job it has done.
Curiously enough, I found on my breakfast table their Annual Report for last year. I looked through it, and I was particularly struck by the immense amount of work that they have been doing overseas. They do it every year, but this year is perhaps the outstanding year. They have been with special missions to America, they have been to Canada, they have been to Western Germany and they have been to the Benelux countries. Your Lordships all know what the result has been. Industry, particularly from North America, has come over to Scotland and set up there. One of the really key factors in our renaissance has been that American industry and foreign industry has been setting itself up in Scotland; and great credit for that is due to the Scottish Council.
Knowing the shortage of time, I want to turn to just two specific points. Before refer to the first, I should like to read—perhaps this is hardly fair, but never mind; I am going to do it—an extract from the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Hughes, at the time of the debate on the development of Central Scotland and North-East England. I want to read this extract because it helps me, and I think will help him, on the first point which want to develop. He said at that time [OFFICIAL REPORT, Vol. 254, col. 292]: I would suggest to the Government that example is much better than precept, and that the Secretary of State for Scotland, with his colleagues, might make some arrangements for one or more Ministries to move some or all of their activities to either Central Scotland or North-East England. My Lords, that may be a pretty difficult task to carry out, at any rate in the first few months of office. But I am going to ask the noble Lord to do something which is somewhat easier—at least I hope it is easier. I am following in the footsteps of the noble Lord, Lord Balerno, in this respect, and I have another candidate for being stared in Scotland—the National Environment Research Council. I know that the Scottish Council have already made certain representations on that subject, but the location has not yet been settled. This does not mean moving a Government Department. This is a new organisation which I hope can be set up somewhere in Scotland, just as Lord Balerno hoped that the National Resources Council could be set up there.
Various noble Lords hoped that we might be able to see an international organisation set up in Scotland, and particular reference was made to the World Health Organisation. I am sure that this would he an excellent thing, and any international organisation which was set up, particularly in Edinburgh, for example, would never regret it. But there is one factor—and this brings me to my second point—which makes it extremely doubtful in my mind that we shall succeed in getting an international organisation with conditions as they are at present. I refer to the fact that if anybody from Europe wants to come to Scotland, they have to go through London. How can we hope to have any international organisation coming to Scotland, when they have always to go through London?
This brings me in detail to my second point, which is that I think—and I know that the noble Lord, Lord Forbes, and other noble Lords have referred to this matter—that the airport at Edinburgh is a national disgrace. There is one runway, and whether or not one gets in depends on the wind. Then, when you do get in, the buildings are such that very often there is standing room only; you cannot even sit down to wait, as so many people ate trying to get in. I think that nothing is more important as a matter of priority than getting on with the improvement of the Edinburgh airport. I believe one noble Lord made the point, which is a good one, that we are sometimes at risk in wanting to "spread the butter too thin". I know I have heard the pleas for airports at Dundee and other places, but once the Tay Bridge has been built the journey from Dundee to Edinburgh will really be no longer than from London to London Airport. So while I am not against the airport at Dundee, I am in favour of making Edinburgh's something really worth while.
It remains for me to wish the noble Lord, Lord Hughes, the best of luck in carrying on what the last Government started so well. If two improvements which so many noble Lords have mentioned and on which I have just touched—namely, some new research bodies or international organisations finding their way to Scotland, and a real improvement in the Edinburgh airport—could be seen to develop from our debate, then I think we should all be very happy.

THE JOINT PARLIAMENTARY UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND (LORD HUGHES) My Lords, in the first instance, I have to express my very sincere thanks to all those noble Lords who have included in their remarks such a very generous welcome to myself in this office, although it must in some cases have been tinged with regret that it involved their own transfer to the other side of the House. But they were so very generous in their remarks that it would have been easy for anyone coming into this House without knowledge of politics to imagine that we were in fact all members of the same political Party.
Noble Lords will not expect me to go into too much detail in reference to the position of the Minister of State. All I would say is that I have taken a record of what has been said, and I find that if any one of eight noble Lords sitting on the opposite Benches should become a Labour Prime Minister during the period in which I am Under-Secretary of State, I can immediately expect to be Minister of State. All I want to say on that aspect is that it may be better to start off as an Under-Secretary, and perhaps have people saying later on, "It is worth making him a Minister", rather than to start off as a Minister and then have them saying, "He ought to be an Under-Secretary".
The debate, as Scottish debates generally are in your Lordships' House, has been very largely, though not entirely, on a non-Party level, and if I should stray from that occasionally it will be only because I feel it necessary in the proper presentation of the case as a member of Her Majesty's Government. I do not intend to dwell too much on what has taken place in the past, because if this debate is to serve a useful purpose it should be in relation to what is going to take place in the future. But I think I should very briefly say a few words of background to remind your Lordships that the state of the Scottish economy has not been a uniformly good one in the past.
It would be futile to go so far back as the inter-war year; that is now really history. But the post-war legacy of Scotland has not been as good as any of your Lordships would have wished it to be. There has been a consistently high level of unemployment, and when I say "high" I mean high in comparison with what prevailed in the country as a whole. If we were comparing the figures of unemployment in Scotland with what had taken place in the 'thirties, what we now regard as high figures we should then have regarded as being low. So at least there is improvement in that direction. The factor which has remained unchanged throughout all these post-war years is that, it has not mattered where the national level of unemployment has been, the Scottish level has consistently been at least twice that figure, and that is still the position to-day.
Another aspect which has been disconcerting is the slow growth of new jobs. It is surprising and disappointing to find, for instance, that in 1961 the number of men employed in Scotland was fewer than it was in 1951. The only significance of these two particular years is that they happen to be the Census years and the years for which the most reliable figures are available. The position since then, unfortunately, despite all the increase in new jobs, is really not appreciably better, and this is very largely because of the factor to which many noble Lords have referred in the course of this debate—the extensive emigration from Scotland, an emigration which grows progressively worse. In 1959 the net loss was 20,000; in 1963 it was 33,000; and this year it is almost certain to exceed 34,000. These are figures which a country the size of Scotland cannot possibly sustain if almost irrecoverable injury is not to be done to our economy.
It is distressing, I think, to find that our net emigration is, with one exception, the worst in Western Europe. I had in my notes the name of the country with the worst, and then I was told to take it out in case we had an international incident. This pattern must obviously be changed as quickly as possible. I believe it would be fair to say that it was the desire of my predecessors at the Scottish Office that it should change as quickly as possible, and I would assure your Lordships that this remains the prime objective of the new Ministers in St. Andrew's House and Dover House.
In recent years (I am now getting a little more political) it has become more fashionable to approve of planning, although the conception of planning of noble Lords opposite has been somewhat different from that of planning as understood on these Benches. The previous Administration thought of it mainly, if not entirely, as physical—the "infrastructure", for example. It was an essential part of planning, and we shall apply it vigorously; but we shall not repeat the mistake of thinking that it is the whole job. It must be complemented by calculated and phased economic growth.
It is significant that the principal examples of this phased, calculated economic growth are the New Towns, to which such generous reference has been made this afternoon. These New Towns came about in the first instance through an. Act of the previous Labour Government—a conscious intervention into deliberate planning of all the aspects of life of a community—and for that Act I should like to say that this country will always be in the debt of my noble friend Lord Silkin. This all-in development must be our general Scottish objective in which all areas in need will share—and I stress that point: that all areas in need will share.
The previous Government's "Proposals for Central Scotland" are being urgently re-examined, first to hasten the elements in that programme which are really fundamental to growth, and secondly to inject the necessary economic and industrial factors into it, in accordance with the principles I have just stated. This will not stop the Government from maintaining the high level of public investment which the regeneration of Central Scotland requires. I must emphasise, however, that this will not be done at the eventual expense of other areas. I am glad to be able to say that the comprehensive plans for North-East Scotland, South-West Scotland, the Borders and the Highlands are being pressed on and should be available, in all probability, by the middle of 1965.
The Borders have figured in more than one speech this afternoon, and the noble Marquess and the noble Baroness both spoke particularly about them. I should like to mention something of the work being done by Government Departments which we have inherited and we are continuing, and the Borders are a very good example. The Study which the Scottish Development Group are doing has made good progress. This is not the time to talk of solutions, or to hint at emerging recommendations, but what I should like to emphasise is how greatly we have gained in our understanding of the real and deep-seated problems in the area by the full and frank discussions which we have pursued with the tweed and knitwear industries there.
I must pay a grateful tribute to the cooperative attitude which both these industries have displayed, which has permitted a wide-ranging discussion between the Departments, on the one hand, and the representatives of industry, on the other. The result has been constructive and, in the best sense of the word, educational; and both sides, I believe, feel the same. There is no question at all here of Government interference in the legitimate freedom of businessmen to make up their own minds and to make their own decisions. It is simply a means of sharpening the awareness of both sides to the real and long-term problems ahead, and of bringing out more clearly the total situation in which, on the one hand, management decisions must be taken and, on the other, planning proposals must be made.
For this task I am confident that the new Scottish planning machinery of which I shall be speaking will be a much better instrument than we have ever had before. Under the guidance of these bodies, we hope to forge links with Scottish industry and to get to grips with the real economic problems of our country. In that connection, I am very glad that the noble Lord, Lord Polwarth, thought that this deeper involvement in planning which he saw forthcoming from the new Government was one to which he and the Scottish Council could give a warm welcome.
Noble Lords are aware of the Government's determination to have a plan for the whole country which will set the right economic targets, and to take the necessary measures to attain them. This plan will be prepared under the direction of the First Secretary of State, and will establish the framework for regional planning throughout the United Kingdom. Within this framework, the Secretary of State for Scotland will be responsible for Scottish planning. Bearing in mind the wide planning—physical, industrial and economic—to which I have already referred, my right honourable friend will reconstitute the Scottish Development Group as the Scottish Planning Board. This will be strengthened in various ways, and provided more directly with economic advice.
The Secretary of State will also appoint a Scottish Planning Advisory Council, whose membership will draw on all the major interests shaping the new Scottish economy: both sides of industry, commerce, local government, the universities, the nationalised industries, et cetera, as well as individuals with special contributions to make to its work. The new machinery will cover the work of all Government agencies working in Scotland. In making these arrangements, my right honourable friend has also in mind the need to take account of the requirements of particular areas of Scotland. We intend to give to the people of Scotland the widest possible say in shaping their future to the patterns of prosperity.
I well remember how, in our last big debate on the Scottish economy, the noble Lord, Lord Polwarth, spoke of the need for both a "big stick" and a "juicy carrot". The Board of Trade are now doing what so many Members of your Lordships' House pressed for then, and, in some cases, had been pressing for for years. The programme of advance factories has been considerably expanded in the announcement made a week ago by my right honourable friend the President of the Board of Trade. These nine additional Scottish factories will undoubtedly help to sweeten the "carrot". The fact that they are all in the central belt is perhaps unfortunate, from the point of view of the other areas, but nine factories in six weeks is pretty good going. I do not say that, arithmetically, we are going to keep it up, producing another nine every six weeks; but I would suggest that the other areas need not feel unduly disappointed that they are not included in the first six weeks. The review of the South-East Survey, the restriction on office development and a very much tougher policy in relation to the issue of industrial development certificates will undoubtedly reinforce the stick. I should like to remind your Lordships also, though many of you know this already, that the Board of Trade regional controllers have been instructed to take a tougher attitude to these applications for industrial development certificates in the really congested areas. This means that in the West Midland conurbations and in the London area industrial projects will not be given I.D.C.s unless there are most compelling reasons for doing so, and—I want to stress this—reasons which would have been accepted by the previous Administration will not be found acceptable to the new Government. With every industrial project it is brought to the attention of the Board of Trade, whether or not the firm has reached the stage for applying for I.D.C., that every effort is being made to persuade them to set up in a development district in Scotland or elsewhere if it will be at all practicable for them to do so.
Some of your Lordships may say that this is not very different from what the previous Administration were doing in these particular directions. I would say it is not. The difference is not in these cases in methods but in the extent to which the methods are applied; and my main criticism in previous debates has not been that the Government have been applying the wrong methods but that they have not carried out these methods to their logical conclusion. I hope that in due course your Lordships will agree that we are at least taking them nearer to a logical conclusion.
My Lords, may I now touch on some of the other issues which are vitally important to Scotland and its future prosperity? Some of these have already been covered by noble Lords who spoke. Nothing is more important in my opinion than research and development, and the whole question is being discussed with the new Ministry of Technology. It is not generally known that Scotland trains U per cent. of the United Kingdom output of scientists and technologists but employs less than 5 per cent; and the noble Lord, Lord Balerno, has given some figures which must be staggering to many of your Lordships and which give point to this and to the importance of dealing with this aspect. A wide-ranging list of possibilities is being examined, including much more direct intervention and encouragement by the Government to help firms to undertake major research contracts. The idea of linking our new universities of Strathclyde, Stirling and Dundee with this type of work is under examination. I could not resist the opportunity of putting in Dundee, although of course it is still some two years away.
LORD BALERNO My Lords, would the noble Lord include the Herriot Watt College?
LORD HUGHES My Lords, I am quite willing to include anything which would help. On this subject of research and development, if one turns to Table 21 of the South-East Study and examines the industries which grew fastest in South-East England between 1959 and 1962 one finds that these are all, by and large, the same as those which are known nationally to spend the largest sums on research and development, so I must agree with those noble Lords who have stressed the importance of this research. If we get the research in the right quantities and in the right places, the industry will most inevitably follow.
Training and retraining of labour got off to rather a slow start in Scotland, but firms are now responding a little more readily to the inducements offered. I cannot emphasise too strongly how important this is, as is also the part which Scotland must play in the industrial training boards now being set up. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State has frequently shown his awareness of the importance of transport and communications in the development of a vigorous economy. No longer will major rail closures be permitted without regard to economic planning.
In reference to what has been said about rail closures, I found a certain amount of amusement in reading the other day of one of the developments in connection with Highland rail closures. A line, the closure of which had been agreed to, is now having two stations kept open as halts because the railways found that the cost of providing the alternative bus service was so fantastic that it was cheaper to keep the stations open. That is a bit of hope for the Borders, they having experience of the alternative, that the picture is not quite so rosy as some enthusiasts for railway closures once thought it might be.
The expansion of existing air services and the creation of new ones is every bit at important as the preservation of essential rail services. I appreciate very much what has been said by the noble Earl, Lord Dundee, and the noble Lord, Lord Forbes, and nothing would have given me more pleasure personally than to announce that to-day Dundee's needs were at last to be adequately met, though it would have been dimmed by what the noble Earl, Lord Perth, said. Unfortunately even the strongest personal desire on my part cannot accomplish in six weeks what our predecessors failed to achieve in twice that number of years. I am certain however that My object all sublime I shall achieve in time, and that noble Lords opposite will be as happy as I and not think in terms of "a punishment to lit the crime" when this Government succeed where their predecessors failed.
There is one field of Scottish activity which is brighter than that of the general problems. That is of the service industries, including construction, in which (and I must admit quite frankly that this figure was a complete surprise to me) 57 per cent. of all Scottish workers are engaged. In general terms, the construction and civil engineering industries are booming in Scotland, with a growth rate of nearly 5 per cent. This is one field where we are like all Western European countries and the United States, for in them all this is the most rapidly expanding sector and is surely and inevitably associated with a growing standard of living. With all that lies ahead of us, this is a fruitful field of study, and we are pushing on with the examination of new techniques and methods initiated by the previous Government.
One of the difficulties I have found in being a Minister, and having to make speeches like this, is that the Departments push so much material on to one that one is in danger of finding oneself still speaking the following day. I assumed that it would be your Lordships' desire that I should pay some attention to what was said in the course of the debate. Having does that, I rigorously cut down on the material with which I have been furnished, and now I find, to my horror, that I have accumulated a bigger pile to reply to than I started with. So, if I may reply somewhat sketchily, I assure your Lordships that any point which I have missed I will most carefully follow up in the weeks that lie ahead by careful study of the Report of to-day's debate, and by a follow-up to the noble Lords individually where that is the right thing to do.
In the case of the noble Earl, Lord Cromartie, who strayed back into the Highlands, notwithstanding the arrangement, he perhaps will gain the advantage that I will treat what he has said as the first point to be replied to in the next debate.
What I will say is this: one of the noble Lords on the other side who was complimenting the noble Lord, Lord Craigton, on the way he carried out his task at the Scottish Office—and, political differences notwithstanding, this is a compliment with which I wish most heartily to associate myself—mentioned the fact that he also had periodically to suffer from the onslaughts of his own supporters. My Lords, this is a fate from which I am protected.
BARONESS HORSBRUGH You wait
LORD HUGHES The noble Lord, Lord Forbes, quoted from the last Government's White Paper about the desirability of integrating the air services. The thought that passed through my mind when he was speaking and when other noble Lords were speaking was the remark which the former Leader of the House made about the things that would be done during the next Government. As more and more noble Lords produced all sorts of projects about which they were so uniformly enthusiastic, but which were not produced during the last four or five years, it seemed to indicate to me that they did not expect to be back in office so very soon, after all. Otherwise I do not think there would have been so many projects for spending public money put forward at this stage.
The noble Earl, Lord Dundee, shows indications that if, during the present Parliament, Dundee has lost one direct spokesman in my coming on to these Benches, Dundee has gained another in the noble Earl. I am certain that the residents of the town from which he takes his title will be glad of the vigorous way in which he is looking after their interests. With regard to the industrial estate to which the noble Earl referred and the need for more industrial building in Dundee, there is one point I can mention. The Dundee Corporation asked for some 40 acres of ground to be released for an industrial estate, and I am happy to be able to say that the Secretary of State has acceded to the request which the Lord Provost made and that this decision has been conveyed to the Dundee Corporation. Forty acres is not a great deal nowadays in terms of industrial use, but I am certain that it will be put to good advantage by the Corporation of Dundee and the Board of Trade.
I had not realised that the noble Baroness, Lady Horsbrugh, had such a profound sense of humour or, for that matter, such an uncomfortably long memory. Still, at the end of the day, I was not so unhappy as I thought I was going to be when she started quoting me.
BARONESS HORSBRUGH I did not want to make the noble Lord unhappy.
LORD HUGHES All right, you did not. As a matter of fact, I thought the score was pretty good. The noble Lady said I had made one prophecy and it came right. I cannot do better than 100 per cent. She went on to speak about specific proposals—I thought she was going to say "pacific proposals", but there was nothing pacific about her particular point. I do not think that she has quite done us justice in the matter, because a number of specific proposals have been put forward already by the Government. The decision to cut down office building in London was taken within days of our coming into office. That was one of the things we wanted to do. We tightened up the issue of industrial development certificates. That is something else which is exceedingly specific, and the way in which it is going to be applied, I venture to suggest, will surprise some noble Lords and will delight many, because it is really going to be tough; and it is from this that the other parts of the country will have most to expect.
Nine new advance factories in Scotland, plus others, is pretty specific. I think that if this Government, in its specific proposals which will help Scotland, can keep on at the rate of the first six weeks, then, at the end of the day, if the noble Baroness does complain about what we are doing, she will have to complain that we are doing, not too little but too much. So, on the whole, I am grateful that she has reminded me that a year ago I was already exercising the need to be cautious in what I was saying in case I had to act on it.
The noble Earl, Lord Selkirk, made some interesting statements of broad policy and I was surprised to find myself so completely in agreement with what he was saying. He put forward not detailed but really broad sound principles, which we must keep in mind and which many noble Lords found were echoing what they themselves had been thinking. On only one point did I find myself not too happy, and that was when the noble Earl said that people went to the South for reasons which were either irrational or economic. If, in saying this, he was talking about people who went to set up industries, then I would agree; but if he was talking about individuals who go to work in these industries, I would not agree. Basically, they go because there are jobs; and not only jobs, but a choice of jobs. This is one of the things we do not have in Scotland, particularly when it comes to professional and scientific people. It is not enough to say to them, "Go to the town of X and there is a good job for you there." A man is reluctant to do this, if he knows that there is no other job to which he can go, if the job he is sent to does not suit him or if he falls out with his employer. That is the sort of thing which has taken so many people, both industrial workers and scientists, to the South-East.
THE EARL OF SELKIRK My Lords, I do not agree with the noble Lord. What I was emphasising was that I consider it probably irrational, and not on economic grounds, why people refuse to start businesses in the Northern part of the island. I was not referring to the drift South.
LORD HUGHES My Lords, as a matter of fact, many people in this part of the world think that when they get beyond Edinburgh they are up above the snow line.
Noble Lords have raised many other points to which I would dearly like to reply, if only because of the courtesy which every one of them has shown to me in this debate, but I am well aware that it is long past the hour that your Lordships are inclined to regard as "this late hour", and I think it would be a bad start for ire to continue speaking for long at this lime of night in your Lordships' House. But I am really grateful for the things that have been said and, as I have already said, I shall study them individually in the Report and follow them up.
There is one thing which I cannot resist the temptation to say. If my status as Government spokesman is somewhat different from what some noble Lords had expected, there is a compensation in it. In the last Parliament, there was generally only one Minister sitting on these Benches speaking for the Scottish Office. That position remains unchanged. But, in the last Parliament, there were at best two sitting on the opposite Benches to speak for Scotland and I am going to have the benefit of a tremendously reinforced Scottish Opposition. The best I can wish them is that they may have very many years in which to perfect their opposition.
The noble Lord, Lord Drumalbyn, put forward a number of very interesting points, as one would expect from one who has been previously in Scottish administration and Board of Trade administration, but he will forgive me if I do not go into detail. But there are three things which I wish to mention. He referred to the setting up in Scotland of complete industrial units, including selling organisations. I agree most wholeheartedly with what he said. One of the things we have found with the American concerns which have set up in Scotland is that they regard these concerns as being in direct competition with their own home bases and give them every encouragement to be really strong competitors, and when they have proved themselves they are allocated a share of the world markets which is theirs. I only wish that Scottish concerns which are branches of English firms had exactly the same measure of autonomy. Anything we can do to encourage that type of development will be done, because I wholeheartedly agree with the noble Lord about the worthwhile nature of these activities.
On mergers, I must confess that it had not occurred to me that the possible loss of research was one of the things connected with some of these mergers. It would not have escaped your Lordships' notice that members of Her Majesty's present Government are not so enthusiastic about some of these mergers as some other people have been. With this added reason for looking carefully at them, I have no doubt that my right honourable friend and my noble friends will be very happy.
I come now to the Solway project. In the course of the debate somebody passed me a note about it. The noble Lord, Lord Drumalbyn, mentioned the proposal for a Solway barrage. This project, of course, is a most imaginative conception. We have been giving it a preliminary examination, and, since the southern shore of the Solway is in Cumberland, have been working in the closest touch with the North-West England Study Group. Before the idea could be put into practice, extensive and costly technical and economic investigation of its various aspects would be necessary. At this stage our view, which has been confirmed by informal technical discussions with experts from Strathclyde University and elsewhere, is that the water aspect would be the one to look into first. I understand that the North-West Study Group are likely to reach a similar conclusion about a comparable project for Morecambe Bay. The next step must therefore be to consider the merits of these two schemes together in the context of the very substantial and competing claims on the nation's capital investment resources over the coming years. This is a task which will be undertaken by the new regional planning machinery which we are setting up. I am sorry that I cannot go further than this, but it is perhaps going a little further than we could have gone even a day or two ago.
The noble Lord, Lord Drumalbyn, asked why there was no Scottish industrialist on the new Council of Technology and my noble friend Lord Snow almost immediately furnished him with an answer. The gentlemen in the Officials' Box have found another one, and they have passed along to me a note saying that in addition to Mr. Brown of Glacier Metal, Limited, who is a Scot, Scotland is also represented by Dr. Curran of the University of Strathclyde, which has close links with industry—links which, as the noble Earl, Lord Selkirk, suggested, we hope to strengthen. I am sorry that the intervention of the noble Lord, Lord Brecon, in this Scottish debate could not find a Welshman on this Council. Perhaps he may accept a second Scot as a reasonable substitute.
The noble Lord, Lord Polwarth, in his remarks, raised the question of the effect of raising the bank rate on Scottish proposals. We are very conscious of the danger that this could have. As noble Lords fully appreciate, this was done as a necessary temporary measure in order to place beyond doubt the Government's determination to maintain the parity of sterling. But, as my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer said yesterday in another place, it is not the Government's desire or policy that there should be a downward revision of investment plans, and it is not our expectation that any such revision will follow. There may, of course, be some effect on the phasing of investment projects, and the Government are, in particular, considering urgently whether some means can be found of mitigating the severity of the bank rate increase, for example, on the housing programme. I hope that, as far as it goes, that is satisfactory. Beyond that I cannot go, even though, in any event, I am straying pretty far from my brief.
The noble Viscount, Lord Stonehaven, made a number of points, particularly about the Highlands. He said that he did not expect a reply to-day, and he will not be disappointed at not getting one. However, I will write to him. The noble Marquess, Lord Lothian, and the noble Baroness, Lady Elliot of Harwood, spoke particularly about the Border problems, and I hope that some of the things I have been able to say will be helpful to them. I should also mention, perhaps, that, notwithstanding my lowly position, I am already doing a number of the things which the noble Lord, Lord Craigton, did, and included in them is a visit to one part of the Borders in a fortnight's time, when I shall be meeting some of the local authorities, and another visit next month when I shall be meeting another set of Border authorities. I may say, incidentally, that I shall also have the pleasure of opening a small factory at Stranraer, and I can now sympathise very much with the noble Baroness, Lady Elliot of Harwood, when she talks about the difficulties of moving about there. We have been talking about (a) how I am going to get there, and (b), how I am going to get away.
The hospital matter which the noble Marquess, Lord Lothian, raised, is, I think, a little away from the context of this debate, but not so far away as I should have said a year or two back. There is an interesting American who has set up an industry which was arranged when I saw him in New York. He put a number of questions to me which brought to me a completely different idea of an industrialist. He asked about a number of things, such as the houses for the people who worked in his place, and what schools there would be. Many industrialists, of course, ask these questions, which are quite usual ones to ask, but the American then asked me another question which I have never before heard an industrialist ask. He wanted to know what the hospital facilities were if any of his workers should fall seriously ill. So it is perhaps not so far away from an industrial and development debate as one might think. I will ask my right honourable friend to look into this question, and either I or she will write to the noble Marquess in due course. The other question the American asked was what were the facilities for his people to worship in a church of their own choice. That is the sort of person we like to see coming into Scotland.
My Lords, I think I have now covered all the points—no: I have not dealt with those raised by the noble Lord, Lord Balerno. Perhaps I should have forgotten these, because I cannot give the noble Lord a satisfactory answer. He raised the point of the possible location of the World Health Organisation and the new Research Body which is to be set up. All I can say is that we are pursuing these matters. The decision is not something that rests finally with the Scottish Office or there would be no doubt as to what the decision would be; just as many of the things which did not happen in the last few years would have taken place if the decision had rested entirely with the noble Lord, Lord Craig-ton. I noticed that, on this point, when the noble Earl, Lord Perth, was raising the same subject, there definitely spoke the former Minister when he wished me luck in the battle with other Government Departments. Believe me, my Lords, this is one aspect of Government which does not change with Party.
I hope that these, I am afraid, somewhat rambling last remarks answer some of the points which your Lordships have raised it the debate. May I be permitted to close on this somewhat general note: that the opinion expressed by so many of those who have taken part in the debate, that they are seeking genuinely to put forward things which will be helpful to Scotland, is something which, in my experience over the last three years, I have found to be genuine. I have not the slightest reason to believe that even the necessity from time to time of immersing ourselves deeply in Party politics will make any difference to the Scottish debates of this character which will occur from time to time. I hope that in the succeeding debates I shall give none of your Lordships any cause to regret the generous things which you said to me during this debate.
LORD CRAIGTON My Lords, I will say only a few words, as is the custom in this House. I am grateful to so many of my noble friends for taking part in this debate, and I know they would wish me to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Hughes, on a charming and competent job. I am glad that he is following, with the qualifications he gave us, in the general line we have taken, and I am sure we shall support much of the policy he so forthrightly described. We are grateful for the information he gave us, and we will study it very carefully. I express the hope that the new Scottish Planning Advisory Council will not be too large. I am glad he is going to follow the practice that has been taken in Scottish debates in answering by letter constructive points—he made that quite clear, and I agree with him. I beg leave to withdraw the Motion standing in my name."""
